Producers could receive\ndeficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not\nmore than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.\n    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20\npct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not\nactively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.\n    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five\nyears, protect family farms and eliminate government\naccumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be\nhalted.\n    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would\n\"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a\nfamily farmer is.\"\n    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program\npayments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.\n    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill\nwould determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and\ntherefore eligible for payments.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system\nwas first introduced in October 1985, but it slid to around 15\nper dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later.\n    Since then, Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of\nabout nine kwacha per dollar.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The Finance Bill will have provisions for\nthe implementation of measures announced in November, it said.\n    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers\nWood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs\non PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.\n    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would\nfavour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields\nsuch Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.\n    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields\nmight also be encouraged, he said.\n    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore\nconstruction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs\nunder the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.\n    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the\ndevelopment of new fields outside the Southern Basin.\n    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the\ncentral and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than\nin the south and thus have greater capital and labour\nrequirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.\n    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure\nwould help fundamental research in the oil industry, although\nthe benefits of this research would not be seen for several\nyear.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The implications for interest rates are very\nfavourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another\nsuch cut before the end of the week,\" Simmonds said.\n    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he\nsaid Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut\nin income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.\n\"There is no real need to boost private consumption,\" he said.\n    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said\nthe lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the\nlikelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.\n    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,\nin particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the\nsharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point\nbase rate cut could be implemented.\n But providing the budget small-print was convincing, \"and I\nsuspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one\npoint off base rates by the end of this week,\" Kern said.\n    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave\nthe way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.\nThis would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer\nprice inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.\n    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11\npct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money\nand government bonds (gilts) markets.\n    But building societies said they would not cut lending\nrates until base rates had fallen by one full point.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Such\ntargets threatened to cause policy conflicts, \"both within\ncountries and between them.\"\n    For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund\nits deficits requires interest rates there be set at high\nlevels, but domestic considerations call for low ones.\n    If target zones were established, this would put \"pressure\non other countries to reduce their interest rates even more,\neven though this may be in conflict with their own domestic\nsituation and priorities,\" he said.\n    Gleske added, \"targeting the exchange rate even within a\nwide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a\nclearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and\nexternal policy priorities.\"\n    Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its\nchances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current\ninterest rate differentials being maintained.\n    These chances \"seem to me to rest critically on the\nexpectation that the current configuration of interest rates,\nand the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth\nfinancing of current account imbalances in the months ahead.\"\n    Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had\nlearned \"that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus\ntend to overshoot.\" He said this \"would seem to be unnecessary\nand should be avoided if at all possible.\"\n    Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if\nmarkets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will\nlead to balanced international payments, he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

First, the\nbuffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather\nthan using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.\n    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be\nfree to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.\n    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could\ncomprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third\nlaid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager\nwould pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be\nset by a formula, the delegates said.\n    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met\nbriefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all\nconsumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction\nto the scheme and will respond to it when the working group\nmeets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.\n    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to\nwork from, one consumer delegate said.\n    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for\nnegotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's budget contained virtually everything the government\nbond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices\nrace ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.\n    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his\nspeech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely\nsharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose\nabout two points on the day.\n    \"This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,\"\nMorgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.\n    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the\nbudget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial\nbank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point\ntomorrow.\n    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection\nof supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget\nwas that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held\nto 4.0 billion stg.\n    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion\nstg.\n    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer\nfar less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and\nthe scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,\nanalysts said.\n    \"The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically\nexpected,\" Bell said. Most market expectations called for the\nChancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.\n    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said\nthat overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less\nin new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in\ntotal new issue volume.\n    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy\nWrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion\nstg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap\nissues.\n    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full\nprice does not have to be paid until the start of the new\nfiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current\nyear's fund raising.\n    But the Bank of England will also be constrained from\nissuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try\nout a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new\nstock.\n    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked\nissue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail\nPrice Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to\nbe raised in the form of traditional stock.\n    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two\npence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line\nwith most market expectations, although some operators had\nexpected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.\n    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,\nShepherd said, because \"If it was more than two pct, they would\nhave become concerned about the economy heating up again.\"\n    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the\nruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut\ncan be offered at budget time next year.\n    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam\non the political implications of the budget which suggests an\nearly election.\n    \"All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the\nmiddle of May,\" Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. \"This makes a June\nelection very likely.\"\n    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from\nthe budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of\nmortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on\npensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.\n    At that rate, they would have been of little use for a\npolitical party expecting to call an election in June.\n    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with\nmeasures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.\n    \"This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour\nparty to attack,\" Shepherd said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel\nLawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced\nby analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.\n    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected\ntomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A\nfollow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.\n    \"Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,\" Peter Fellner,\nU.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. \"It was\na very, very prudent fiscal budget.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a\nwell-balanced budget within the confines of the government's\nphilosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.\n    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal\nside, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.\n    As was widely expected, Lawson split his \"fiscal adjustment\"\nbetween trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg\nfrom 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to\n27 pct.\n    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was\nkept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad\nSterling M3 aggregate was dropped.\n    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for\na half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the\nauthorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.\nMany analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full\none-point cut tomorrow.\n    \"The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which\nit will have to reverse later,\" Jeffrey said, though he added a\nfurther half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.\n    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for\ninflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained\nin it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.\n    Holt noted the \"rather loose\" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct\nat end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result\nfrom the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.\n    \"A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,\"\nhe said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of\nfalling base rates would have an offsetting impact on\ninflation.\n    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but\nit was \"not a good budget for inflation,\" he said\n    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about\nthe dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not\ntoo concerned about a revival of inflation.\n    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the\n\"leading edge\" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were\nlikely to be extremely cautious on this front.\n    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest\nrates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any\nsigns of excessive weakness.\n    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility\nof the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.\n    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from\n1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,\nwhich are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.\nthat the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by\nthe favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast\nto be 4.0 billion stg.\n    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any\nclear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,\nwhich has to be held before June, 1988.\n    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the\nbenefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise\nduties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.\n    But others said it kept several options open and it was not\npossible to deduce too much from it.\n    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,\nLawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in\nthat there would be no \"chickens coming home to roost.\"\n    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June\nelection, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for\na Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.\n    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost\nto the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level\nwould be chancy since it will take a long time for any\ntransaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals\nnecessary for the broadcast properites.\n    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion\ndlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected\nthe bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,\nits financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives\nsuch as restructuring.\n    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,\nwhich has two large shareholders in an investment group led by\nRobert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial\nCorp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds\n16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50\nyears ago, has about 12 pct.\n    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange\nCommission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.\n    \"I could see if things got really crazy that it might go\nfor 175 (dlrs per share),\" said one arbitrager, but he\nspeculated it probably would not even be taken over for more\nthan a price in the 160s.\n    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he\nspeculated the investor would not really be interested in\nrunning the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.\n    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said\nhe had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged\nbuyout.\n    \"Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all\nthe interests involved,\" he said, adding the two largest\nshareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.\n    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the\ncompany has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest\nestimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the\nlatter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the\nbroadcast industry.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained,\"\nAl-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures,\nsome states depended on associated gas output for domestic use\nand oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added.\n    Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the\norganization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in\nFebruary, although this had meant sacrifices.\n    The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability,\nthough restored to a good level, was still under pressure,\nAl-Wattari said. \"A lasting stability in the world market\nrequires a wider scope of international cooperation,\" he added.\n    He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a\npolitical willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC.\n    But although cutbacks announced by these states were\npolitically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were\ninsufficient in terms of volume, he added. \"The overall majority\nof non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's\ncalls for supply regulation,\" he said.\n    Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it\nallowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to\ncontinue, while not generating excessive cash flow for\notherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price\nwould no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added.\n    Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also\naddressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed\nto prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market.\n    Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous\nfor both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation\nwould ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It has given money to the \"haves\" as\nopposed to the \"have-nots.\"\n    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it \"a bribes budget.\"\n    Kinnock said the budget \"had little to do with the general\ngood, and everything to do with the general election.\"\n    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said\n\"the Tories should have used available resources to invest in\nindustry, in health and in education.\"\n    He added that \"we know that whoever is elected (to power in\nthe next general election) will reverse these tax cuts.\"\n    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury\nexpected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for\nuse in cutting taxes or raising public spending.\n    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the\ngovernment would be forced to call an election by a\ndeteriorating economy.\n    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said\nthat \"the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than\nit has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh\nyear of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been\ncombined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and\nstrong, and unemployment is falling.\"\n    He said that \"these are the fruits of the government's\ndetermination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to\nour policies of sound money and free markets.\"\n    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to\nplump for an early election.\n    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would\nhave on election timing, he replied \"I think we will hold the\nelection either late or early. I must confess I am rather\nrelaxed about it all.\n    \"There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.\n    But he added that \"if the Prime Minister decides to go for\nan early election, it will bring to an end all this rather\nridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is\nsomething to be said for that.\"\n    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of\nBritish Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said \"This budget\nwill reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing\nmeans lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI\nwanted.\"\n    \"We have always said we would judge the budget on how it\naffects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Surprisingly strong U.S. housing\nstatistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that\nthe economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient\ncause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,\neconomists said.\n    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually\nmild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that\nseasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the\neconomy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And\nafter a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.\n    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a\nseasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804\nmln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April\n1986.\n    The rate at which permits were issued for future building\nclimbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764\nmln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.\n    \"February's weather is usually more adverse for home\nbuilding. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to\ndetermine what this means for the economy down the road,\" said\nAllan Leslie of Discount Corp.\n    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for\nweather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures\ninflate the statistics.\n    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to\nbuilding last month. But several believe that rates will now\nconsolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.\n    \"Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying\n'Let's do it now',\" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of\nSavings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much\nof the financing for home building.\n    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward\npotential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and \nsome overall improvement in the U.S. economy.\n    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early\nsummer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last\nNovember, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.\n    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in\nthe single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which\ntypically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high\nvacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units\nfollowing tax law changes effective January 1.\n    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317\nmln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.\n    \"Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low\nmortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not\nlooking at a great deal of growth potential,\" said Ward\nMcCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with\nlarger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial\noutput and retail sales in February, may cause some observers\nto start waving \"four pct GNP banners\" for the first quarter.\nGross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.\n    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to\ncome in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not\nconvinced that growth will pick up in future.\n    \"The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on\nnow, not all of which is intentional,\" he said. For example,\nU.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,\nproduced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February\ncompared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.\n    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first\nquarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker\ngrowth in the second, he said.\n    \"If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building\nand we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then\nthere is the potential for softness in the second quarter,\"\nagreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating\nfirst quarter GNP prospects.\n    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that\ncurrent data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.\n    \"At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the\nfirst quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the\nsecond,\" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei\nInc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

New Brunswick said it is also\nconcerned that Hydro-Quebec is taking all the U.S. export\nmarkets.\n    Hydro-Quebec spokesman Maurice Hebert said several\nprovinces, including Newfoundland which wants to renogotiate a\npower agreement with Quebec, routinely oppose the Quebec\nutility's export contracts.\n    Hebert said the National Energy Board has ordered changes\nto contracts in the past but has always left the agreements\nessentially intact.\n    He said the utility was not prepared to comment on whether\nit believed the board would call for substantial changes to the\nagreement with New England.\n    He said the hearings, which began today, will probably last\ntwo or three days and a decision made in about two weeks.\n    Hydro-Quebec has recently been trying to move from export\ncontracts for surplus energy to contracts for guaranteed\namounts of energy, such as the deal signed with Maine.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln\ndlrs.\n    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln\ndlrs.\n    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987\nwinter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.\n    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to\nwheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling\non the disaster assistance program.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all\nor part of the companies.\n    Independent economists warn that the deficit could push\ninflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the\ngovenment target of 40-50 pct.\n    Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline\nwith a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private\ninvestors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in\neight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.\n    Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said\nthe government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,\nincluding those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock\nexchange.\n    Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the\npossible sale of a company producing palm oil and another\nmanufacturing electrical appliances.

Their secretaries\nsaid they were out of their offices.\n    Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima\nstock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be\nsold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase\nstock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.\n    He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad\nuntil at least july 1988.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

If they do, then the certificate program is\ngood,\" an OMB official told Reuters.\n    Landis calculated that the redemption of each certificate\nworth 1,500 bushels results in 176 dlrs in storage savings for\nwheat farmers, 270 dlrs for corn farmers and 92 dlrs for\nsoybean farmers. The pik and roll strategy represents a benefit\nof about 35 cents per bushel per farmer, he said.\n    But Landis also noted that recent studies by CBO suggest\nthat an additional one billion dlrs of certificates released to\nthe market could result in outlays of 1.15 dlrs in cash for\nevery dlr released in certificates.\n    OMB is concerned that too many certificates released onto\nthe market could cause prices to drop too low and government\ncosts to increase too much.\n    But Landis said OMB has not determined what amount of\ncertificates would be excessive.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This helped\nincrease marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices\naveraged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they\nwould have otherwise.\n    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40\nto 50 mln bushels, it said.\n    The department said government spending on farm programs in\nfiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from\n1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.\n    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half\nof the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,\nannual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last\nyear's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.\n    The department said the President's budget proposals for\n1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24\nbillion dlrs.\n    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain\nclose to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct\naverage of 1980-86, it said.\n    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume\nis expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven\nyears, the department said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks\nprofits as a whole.\n    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a\nnightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.\n    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change\nare those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin\nAmerica. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were\ninvolved expect to suggest it was a \"sizable number.\"\n    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made\non or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest\narising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the\nmeasures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.\n    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of\nwithholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce\ninterest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue\nto the U.K. Treasury.\n    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the\nsubsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and\nbring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas\ncompetitors.\n    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the\nTreausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over\ntime from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.\n    But while compliance with the new measures could\nnecessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return\nto the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.\n    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans\ncontains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the\ntax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent\nthe loans would and could be changed.\n    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland\nRevenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these\nloans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a\nminimum.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

In the first two\nmonths of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.\n    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus\ncaused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension\nof interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial\ndebt.\n    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new\nmeasures to correct the economy would be announced within a\nmonth, although he gave no further details.\n    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said \nBrazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to\nget additional assistance from commercial banks and others.\n    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the\nBrazilian cabinet.\n    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earlier\ntoday the government was considering a suggestion by the Chief\nof Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a new\nmulti-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's\ncurrent economic difficulties.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

If\na voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then\nthe commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,\"\nthe NASD said.\n    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the\nOTC offered only one class of stock.\n    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a\nuniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal\nvoting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.\n    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not\nhave voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled\nout to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from\nturning voting shares into non-voting shares, without\nshareholder approval, Parrillo said.\n    \"A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been\nconstrued by some to be an abusive practice involving the use\nof stock with other than full voting rights,\" the association\nsaid in the statement.\n    Exceptions would include:\n    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts\nconnected with the company's capital structure are clearly\nspelled out in the prospectus.\n    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition\nor recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied\nby detailed proxy material.\n    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of\nstock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority\nof independent directors on the board approve the move. The\nNYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual\nclasses to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.\n    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual\nclass shares where those with superior voting rights are not\nresalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect\nprevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

I don't pay attention to\nthe cost of living,\" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old\nCanadian teacher of English in Tokyo.\n    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by \"chatting\" 40\nhours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the\nlanguage. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet\ntwo-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of\nTokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has\nmanaged to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.\n    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating\nout once a day.\n    \"For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes\nwith soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso\nsoup, rice and tea,\" although she takes only coffee for\nbreakfast and a sandwich for dinner.\n    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents\nsee no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by\nforeign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.\n    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the\nprice to bring over the best people needed to back up their\npush into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.\n    \"You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and\ntrade down. It's not reasonable,\" said a spokesman for\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports\nWestern lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.\n    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business\ntravellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions\nAbroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on\naverage more than 300 dlrs a day.\n    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,\nmany tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to\nvisit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.\n    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates \"endaka\" caused an 11.5\npct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.\n    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by\ncurtailing shopping, it said.\n    To help combat \"endaka\" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist\nBureau prepared a pamphlet, \"Economical Travel in Japan.\"\n    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced\nbusiness hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public\nbaths while getting a \"revealing glimpse of Japanese in their\ndaily lives.\"\n    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's\nShin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.\n    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding\nEnglish teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,\nberth-sized twin-room in the Japanese \"flop house.\"\n    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for\nwork. \"Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll\nsplurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited\npizza for at least two hours.\"\n    Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. \"I had to\nspend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire\nbusiness after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all\nbut its graphic arts-related businesses.\n    Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon\nby the Japanese, the trading company official says. \"Japanese\npeople don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable\ndeals.\" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese\ncompanies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. \"This is\na healthy progression.\"\n    However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the\nboard meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.\n    \"Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a\nlarge U.S. Or European corporation,\" one banker said. \"They will\nexpand their operations only gradually, a typical way for\nJapanese business.\"\n    A foreign merchant banker also noted, \"There are not many\nmega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big\ndeals there have already been done.\"\n    But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of\nJapanese companies, the specialists said.\n    Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in\nhigh-technology areas. \"Japanese companies had used technology\nand quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate\nfrom that trend,\" one takeover specialist said.\n    Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If\nthese succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.\n    But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait\nuntil the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading\nhouses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and\nforeign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as\ngo-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But there are still\nobstacles to trading on the London market.\n    \"Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are\nmajor obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,\" said Koki\nChiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's\nbond administration division.\n    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese\nsecurities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE\non these matters.\n    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with\ncoupon payment of either March and September, or June and\nDecember from April 1, matching futures delivery months.\n    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and\nDecember. When delivery months and coupon payments do not\nmatch, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned\nby non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities\nmanagers said.\n    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of\nbonds with matching months increases to over several billion\nyen, bond managers said.\n    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are\nexpected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low\ninterest rates, they said.\n    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to\nbe set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash\nissues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of\n1987.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Babcock, which has set an unchanged\nthree mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last\nweek that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.\nThese shares will be placed with institutional investors.\n    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,\nwhich share market analysts said was likely be used partly to\nfinance expansion, especially in environment technology.\n    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major\nFrankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to\nbring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered\nheavy losses in the early 1980s.\n    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these\nlosses, which were due to problems linked with three major\ncontracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net\nloss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.\n    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its\nresults in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose\nfrom the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.\n    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the\npricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was\nunfortunate.\n    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in\nVEBA AG &lt;VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely\n2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with\na large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener\ninsurance group.\n    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has\ngenerally put pressure on West German stocks which have also\nsuffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.\n    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with\nIran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since\n1975.\n    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the\nmarket took the news calmly. Analysts said today the\ncombination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not\nhave a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct\nplacement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors\nboth in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Talks are underway between financially\ntroubled Zaire and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) aimed\nat rescuing the economy of the second largest nation in\nsub-Saharan Africa.\n    Diplomatic and banking sources in Kinshasa agreed that a\ncompromise formula could be reached in the coming weeks\nenabling pro-Western Zaire to obtain a much needed injection of\ncash.\n    For its part the government is expected to increase\nbudgetary discipline, which in turn is likely to attract\nforeign investors, the sources said.\n    \"Barring last-ditch obstacles, which can't be totally ruled\nout in an issue involving a nation's pride and substantial\npolitical and economic interests, Zaire and its creditors are\nbound to come to terms soon,\" a Western diplomat told Reuters.\n    \"The Zairean economy won't survive without massive IMF\nassistance. Similarily, the West has no interest to see Zaire's\nstrategic minerals fall into communist hands,\" the diplomat\nsaid.\n    Zaire defied its creditors late last year by saying it\nwould limit repayments on its five billion dlr external debt to\n10 pct of its export earnings from January 1987.\n    The government also announced an end to the floating\nexchange rate for the zaire currency and a return to a fixed\nparity against special drawing rights (SDRs) with periodic\nadjustments.\n    Until last year, Zaire devoted up to 28 pct of its export\nrevenue to servicing large foreign debts contracted during the\ncopper boom of the 1970's to finance largely non-productive and\noften extravagant investment projects.\n    Zaire, the world's leading cobalt producer and the sixth\nlargest supplier of copper, depends on the two minerals for\ntwo-thirds of its export earnings.\n    \"A young country cannot go on indefinitely sacrificing\neverything for the sake of servicing its external debt,\"\nPresident Mobutu Sese Seko commented in October when he\nannounced his government's decision.\n    As early as January 1986, Mobutu had warned that \"one does\nnot feed on austerity and praise. I have another debt, one\ntoward my people and my people's efforts must not backfire,\" he\ntold diplomats.\n    Zaire pointed out that during four years of IMF-backed\nausterity (1983-86), it had become a net exporter of capital\nwithout receiving appropriate financing from abroad.\n    Economists said that since the large devaluation of the\nzaire currency in September 1983, the country suffered a net\noutflow of 830 mln dlrs each year.\n    Zaire's medium and long term public debt in the past few\nyears reached an equivalent of about 100 pct of its Gross\nNational Product (GNP), one of the highest such ratios in the\nworld, banking sources said.\n    Mobutu accused the IMF of \"strangling\" his country at an\nOctober meeting of the ruling MPR party and said his people\ncould not long endure the hardship caused by austerity.\n    Zairean officials blame their present difficulties on the\nIMF recovery plan's two basic assumptions which, they said,\nfailed to materialise last year,\n    - a world economic recovery pushing up commodity prices and\nboosting Zaire's export revenue and debt servicing capacity,\n    - substantial, additional financial help from the country's\ntraditional donors.\n    In 1983 Zaire set out on a major economic reform aimed at\ncurbing its soaring debt. It floated its currency, slashed\nspending and privatised industry, gaining praise from Western\ncreditors and obtaining debt rescheduling.\n    As a result, the overall economic and financial situation\nimproved markedly, with inflation down to 41 pct last year from\n100 pct in 1983.\n    But it also led to a severe and steady fall in living\nstandards for Zaire's 35 mln population, fuelling widespread\ndiscontent among poorer city dwellers, diplomats said.\n    Economists estimate the drop in purchasing power at between\n20 and 35 pct for an average household over the last 12 months,\ndespite a pay rise of up to 67 pct for civil servants announced\nlast May.\n    The World Bank has released in the last two months half of\na previously-agreed 80 mln dlrs industrial sector loan and lent\n27.6 mln dlrs to modernise the country's vital river transport\nsystem.\n    Belgium, Zaire's former colonial ruler and its main trading\npartner, recently agreed to release a total of 17 mln dlrs to\nease payments difficulties and finance imports of spare parts\nfor industry.\n    A new agreement between the IMF and Zaire would pave the\nway for another debt rescheduling, probably at the next meeting\nof the Paris Club of Western creditor nations, diplomats said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson\nsaid he was content with the current level of sterling and\nwelcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in\nBritish bank base lending rates to 10 pct.\n    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to\ndeclines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in\nfinancial markets might push for big moves quickly.\n    He told a briefing of economic journalists that \"I don't\nthink we should rush anything.\" Lawson stressed the themes of\n\"gradualism and steadiness\" as economic policy.\n    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates\nwere in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled\nyesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the\nkey Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of\nGDP.\n    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made\nthis month in the form of half percentage point declines, were\n\"perfectly consistent\" with monetary conditions now in Britain.\n    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply\naggregate was \"safely inside\" its flucuation band of two to six\npct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set\nno explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.\n    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the\nexchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),\nLawson repeated that \"it is most unlikely we will enter before\nthe next election.\"\n    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS\nmembership under constant review. But he would not indicate\nwhat the chief considerations for this were for the government.\n    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a\ndecision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of\nthe U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on\nother EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.\n    Although Lawson denounced what he said was \"the current wave\nof election fever\" in Britain, he added:  \"It is more likely that\nthere will be an election this year\" than not.\n    He said he supported an early election only because it\nwould clear the air. \"Ideally, we (the government) should have a\nfull term,\" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson\nsaid.\n    The government, which has been in power since 1979, must\ncall an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either\na June or an early autumn election, political sources said.\n    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88\n\"was the right balance, economically and politically,\" he said.\n    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate\nof tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted\nthat with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have\nallowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.\n    But it was being praised today by political analysts as a\nshrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not\nbe seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe\nthe electorate.\n    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much\nthe PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion\nstg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.\n    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson\nstressed that \"they are not an objective (for the government) -\nthey are an instrument of policy.\" Consequently the Treasury had\nno precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.\n    But \"there may be interest rate consequences\" from changes in\nthe level of government borrowing, he added.\n    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively\nhigh level of real interest rates had hurt investment in\nBritain.\n    He said conditions created by London's role as a leading\nfinancial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be\nhigher in real terms than in other countries.\n    Three factors had caused the higher level in relative\ninterest rates in Britain, Lawson said.\n    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest\nrates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.\n    He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused\nby proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.\n     Thirdly, he said \"we do not have as long a track record of\nlow inflation\" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.\n    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent\nfinancial centre, because it was more international in\ncharacter and more favourably placed in time zones than New\nYork or Tokyo.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Long-term\nrates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.\n    Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and\nthe key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.\n    The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the\nearly part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on\nthe Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a\nbasket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.\n    \"A marked improvement in the balance of payments is\nforecast,\" the NZIER said. \"The current account deficit is\nexpected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in\n1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.\"\n    The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32\nbillion N.Z.

Some said it was likely to\nreturn to within the target range later this year.\n    \"The special factors which boosted money supply growth last\nyear are disappearing,\" one economist said.\n    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986\nwas caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.\n    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic\ncredit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock\ngrowth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.\n    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope\nfor a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.\n    Money market dealers said period rates remained little\nchanged, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.\n    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95\nyesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.\n    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on\nbehalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But\nrates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect\nof this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for\nthe federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.\n    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities\nrepurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in\nrates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned\nbanks.\n    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown\nthe Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.\n    One dealer said, \"If the central bank wanted lower interest\nrates, it would first of all drive call money rates down.\"\n    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve\nassets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on\nMonday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of\nMarch. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The cuts follow nearly two months after the\nBundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the\nusual interim period.\n    A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting\nleading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis\nby 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>\nand Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank\nfuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.\n    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to\ngauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings\nbanks.\n    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could\nreduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to\ndraw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one\neconomist at the German Banking Association said.\n    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially\nundercut by lower savings rates because many customers are\nparking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest\nthem at higher yields in the future, he said.\n    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more\nfunds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated\nsecurities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money\nsupply aggregate.\n    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5\npct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,\nunchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the\nexpanded target range of three to six pct.\n    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private\ncustomers, though lending rates for corporate customers are\nbeginning to decline.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Audi had predicted last\nyear that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified\namount from 1985's record levels.\n    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from\n9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10\nbillion this year.\n    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the\nparent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi\nwould ensure VW got a share of profits.\n    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free\nreserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years\nVW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.\n    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output\ncaused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on\ncurrency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About\nalleged \"sudden acceleration\" of some of its Audi 5000 models.\n    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct\nto 59,800 last year.\n    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom\nout in 1987.\n    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.\n    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,\nbut domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180\nin 1985.\n    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the\nfirst two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall\nmarket share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the\nsame months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales\nfell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide\ndeliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to\n57,000.\n    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to\nover 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen\ncompared with 1985's 392,000.\n    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to\nfurther new hiring of employees.\n    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record\n39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Most of the cattle now being placed on\nU.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on\nfeed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle\nprices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.\n    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a\nlonger time blunted the market impact of the high placements\nreported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock\nanalysts said.\n    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in\nseven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had\nexpected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a\n15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.\n    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted\nreports that many cattle put on feed were relatively\nlightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter\ncattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the\nsummer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally\nplaced on feed.\n    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to\nobtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge\nthat lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.\n    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,\nhelps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from\nFebruary, 1986.\n    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes\nsaid, \"The probabilities are high that in order to place that\nmany cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to\nlighter-weight cattle.\n    The only statistics available are from some terminal\nmarkets which represent only a small percentage of the total\ncattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs\nin February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.\n    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,\nGrimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.\n    If the average weight is down, and there is no price\nweakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at\nlighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as\nthree pct.\n    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly\nLBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly\nbecause of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle\nprices.\n    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain\nsupplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle\nprices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from\nwheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.\n    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat\npasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.\n    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and\nGraham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend\nis to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his\narea benefited from a dry, mild winter.\n    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and\nsome cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less\nthan normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This should cut the global oversupply to 850\ntonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes.\n    The study noted that the effects of last year's lower\nprices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which\nwas now back down to around levels of a decade ago.\n    However, the study said that primary production, likely to\nreach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in\n1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls.\n    Around a third of silver production comes from heavily\nindebted Mexico and Peru.\n    Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the\nmajority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Money market rates\nrecovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling\nand gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.\n    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and\nthe reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors\nwas set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt\nprices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.\n    \"Today's cut was slightly disappointing,\" said Bill Martin,\nchief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. \"The\nBank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper\nthe markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget.\"\n    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash\nto U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to\nmaintain the new rates for about that period of time.\n    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how\nsterling performs in the near term.\n    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially\nthrough Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains\nwould force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.\n    \"The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the\ntime being,\" said Midland Bank treasury economist David\nSimmonds. \"But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold\nup rates for long.\"\n    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents\nthis week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.\n    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan\nSecurities, said \"There is another half point to come in the\nnear term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a\nwhole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks.\"\n    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had\nvery little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange\nrate.\n    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of\na sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not\nmaterialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact\non manufactured exports would show almost immediately.\n    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well\nas cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances\nof re-election for the Conservative government and probably\nadvanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.\nCombined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this\nwas likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated\nassets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial\ntargets.\n    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour\nbecause of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's\nMarshall said \"Sterling is simply the best game in town,\nespecially after the budget, and demand will remain strong.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry\nplans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of\nrecession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts\nand greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.\n    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored\nrationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the\nmarket which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea\nthrough currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.\n    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct\nmore competitive than Japan's due to such factors.\n    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of\ncurrent capacity within two years through mergers and\nregrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month\nand likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.\n    They said from September a semi-government body will assure\nrepayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred\nthrough job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another\n30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.\n    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied\nto the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage\nbuilt to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.\n    The commission has held several hearings with the industry\nand approval should be given this month, the sources said.\n    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a\nplanned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support\nshould help Japanese yards recover their international\ncompetitiveness, they said.\n    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of\nbuilding ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a\nmaximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)\nin 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.\n    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most\nyards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.\n    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for\n1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to\n3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.\n    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to\n30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between\n1986 and 1989.\n    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,\nfollowed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's\nRegister of Shipping.\n    However, falling orders and declining international\ncompetitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in\nthe industry, the sources said.\n    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding\ncompanies reported current deficits in the first half of the\nyear to March 31 and five of them are expected to report\ncurrent deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.\n    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise\nproductivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also\nbeen hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt\nyears, the sources said.\n    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in\nfierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The\ntwo largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>\nand Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --\naccount for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.\n    \"World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out\nthe recession as their technology is the best in the world,\"\nsaid an official at a major Japanese shipping company.\n    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,\nhas no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,\nand this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The mild winter and early reopening of\nthe mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the\nfirmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.\n    The higher transportation costs have served to depress\ninterior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by\nthe elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as\ndiscouraging farmer marketings, they said.\n    \"The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,\"\nwhich indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much\nas 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader\nsaid.\n    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,\nfreight rates will settle back down because of the overall\nsurplus of barges on the Midwest river system.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The government announced a three billion\nfranc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation\namong political and economic analysts that it is positioning\nitself for a period of economic reflation.\n    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister\nJacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe\nSeguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc\ncontingency fund announced on February 25.\n    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a\nreflationary program.\n    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for\nmore than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third\nof French unemployed, government figures show.\n    The main measures of the employment program give employers\nfinancial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at\nleast two years and stress retraining to help the long-term\nunemployed return to the labour market.\n    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security\ncontributions are the main incentives for employers.\n    \"Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong\nincentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour\nmarket and that's why the proposals...Are costly,\" an aide to\nSeguin said.\n    The analysts said speculation the government is considering\na reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis\nBaudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally\nagreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.\n    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out\neconomic stimulation despite the government's revision of its\n1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.\n    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's\nremarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate\nthe economy through a boost to consumer spending although\ngovernment policy allowed for increased industrial investment\nfrom the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.\n    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue\nfrom privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt\nand providing state enterprises with fresh capital.\n    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly\nreflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on\nsocial issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.\n     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of\nstrikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and\ndrove the government into a new mood of conciliation with\nlabour.\n     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation\nof Cie de Saint Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas\n&lt;PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year\nprivatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it\nthis year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in\n1988.\n    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted\nrevenue to boost industrial and research investment and\nspending on infrastructure such as the national motorway\nnetwork.\n   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last\nyear by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage\nmore flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by\nimproving the competitiveness of French industry.\n    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and\nvariations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put\nto parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed\nfor procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of\nState.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Hopes that\nforeign aid would finance 780 mln dlrs  of the 1.14 billion dlr\nbudget deficit have been dashed, they added.\n    Sudanese officials said Prime Minister Sadeq al-Mahdi's\ngovernment would shortly announce a four-year economic plan\naimed at starting the country's recovery.\n    Details of the plan have not been made public. But the\nsources said it would be geared to generate agricultural\nexports and would need a substantial injection of fresh loans\nthat Sudan hoped to receive from Gulf Arab states.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling\nlast year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas\nbubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next\nwinter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts\nsaid.\n    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that\nis difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could\nmore than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by\n1990, some analysts said.\n    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities\nand big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of\nactivity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of\nthe nation's largest gas reserves are located.\n    \"We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,\" said\nJames Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. \"Many\ncompanies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling\nbecause they're betting that the gas market will be back in\nbalance in a year or two.\"\n    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news\nfor drilling and oilfield service companies that barely\nsurvived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a\nbarrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil\nprices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a\nreturn to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig\ncount soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield\nroustabouts commanded premium wages.\n    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a\nbarometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs\nactive in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.\n    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but\ndived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil\nprices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.\n    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said \"In 1986, the United\nStates replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that\nreplacement rate won't be any better this year.\"\n    He added, \"We don't have the options we do with oil.\nImports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and\nimporting liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible\nin the next 10 years because of the cost.\"\n    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves\nwere discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16\ntrillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.\n    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co\nagreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a\nnew cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.\n    \"We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to\ndedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990\nsupplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later\nthan mid-1988,\" Gaspar said.\n    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\ncould last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\nto peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\n    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\nconducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\nfederal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\ngovernment unless drilling begins in the next two or three\nyears. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\nCorp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\nalready indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\nthis year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\n    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will\nspend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\nproduction platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\ngas per day.\n    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\nKansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in\nrecent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\non the verge of a recovery.\n    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\n600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\n    \"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\nabove 30 dlrs a barrel,\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\nexpect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\n    Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\nis skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\n    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\nsignificant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\nwhen the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\nseven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\ndlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\ndlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Latin American sugar producers\nare awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving\nto boost production, official and trade sources said.\n    Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.\nCents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the\nregion's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.\n    The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the\nalert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),\ntold Reuters.\n    However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven\ncents to stimulate notable increases in output.\n    \"Producers are taking measures for increasing their\nproduction when the prices are profitable,\" he said.\n    Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued\nrise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders\nin Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.\n    \"The prices are ridiculous,\" said Julian Mateo, vice\npresident of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural\nLeague. \"At current prices nobody is going to consider\nincreasing production.\"\n    Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing\noutput, given the instability of world markets.\n    An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar\nCane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.\n\"The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet\ngiving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify\nanything.\"\n    In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are\navailable, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln\ntonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A\nyear earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000\nmore, according to the London-based International Sugar\nOrganization.\n    Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar\nindustry in many countries in the region into a recession from\nwhich it will be hard to recover.\n    Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's\nNational Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost\nproduction even if prices recovered sharply.\n    Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from\n900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport\nand badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short\nterm recovery in output, he added.\n    Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar\nexporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end\nof the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is\nrunning well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.\n    Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems\nand poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,\nsince much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries\nunder special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its\ntroubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in\n1985.\n    The low world prices of recent years have led many\ncountries in the region to cut exportable production to levels\nwhere they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean\ncountries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which\nthey receive prices well above free market levels.\n    Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to\nproduction stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to\nthe free world market.\n    Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In\nboth 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year\nits quota is only 37,000.\n    A national cooperative official said that, as long as world\nmarket levels continue at around half of Peru's production\ncost, the future of the industry is uncertain.\n    At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials\nstressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane\nwhich, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo\nLatorre, \"grows like a weed\" throughout the region.\n    Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240\nmln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in\nexcess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into\nsugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.\n    The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol\nInstitute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from\nforeign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.\n    Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the\npast year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant\nBrazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in\n1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to\nnext year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point\nbeing how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of\nsugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would\ncost eight cents to replace.\n    Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export\nsales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with\nthe Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of\neither alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild\ndepleted reserve stockpiles.\n    However, the situation could change dramatically if the\neconomy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.\n    Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little\nhope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability\nunless the U.S. And EC change their policies.\n    \"The agricultural policies of the European Community and of\nthe United States have caused our economies incalculable harm\nby closing their markets, by price deterioration in\ninternational commerce and furthermore by the unfair\ncompetition in third countries,\" Brazil's Trade and Industry\nMinister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA\nmeeting.\n    The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for\nwhat the group charges is its continued dumping of excess\noutput on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the\nmain cause of low prices.\n    GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which\nwould regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the\nregion's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement\nwould have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised\ncountries would have to see it as a political rather than a\nmerely economic pact.\n    \"They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,\nthe less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the\nregion's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,\" GEPLACEA's Latorre\nsaid.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender\noffer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be\nenough to buy the company, analysts said.\n    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General\nPartners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of\nGenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty\nsurrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to\nGencorp broadcasting licenses.\n    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.\n    \"The expectation is either there will be someone else or\nthe bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's\ncooperation,\" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton\ngroup.\n    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to\nGencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio\nstations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,\nwere brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments\nand political contributions.\n    \"I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,\"\nsaid Baker of the offer.\n    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue\nmight be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time\nfor any transaction.\n    A source close to General Partners, however, said General\nPartners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission\nfor special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.\nThe source said if approved, the authority would allow a\ntransaction to be carried out.\n    If it received the \"short-form\" approval, General Partners\nwould set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting\nproperties until the licensing situation is resolved.\n    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and\nBrown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.\n    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as\nGeneral Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of\nthe challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell\nthe stations.\n    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt\nDisney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.\nDisney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a\ngroup that challenged the station's license.\n    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in\nSecaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.\n    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's\nplastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and\nrelated products segment.\n    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said\nthat, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as\nmuch as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace\nbusiness could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion\ndlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,\nincluding assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per\nshare, he said.\n    The company, formerly known as General Tire\nand Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be\nworth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling\nbusiness might also be worth several dollars per share, he\nsaid.\n    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who\nbecame chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's\nAerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,\nfounded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the\nyears and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.\n    \"The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal\nwith the non-strategic assets of the company,\" Rose said.\n    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but\nthey declined to predict what steps the company might take.\nThey said it would be possible the company might consider a\nleveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.\n    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there\nwas some concern about \"greenmail.\" Greenmail is the payment at\na premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.\n    \"I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing\nsurprises me anymore,\" said Rose.\n    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained\nFirst Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>\nChairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to\nreschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six\nmonths.\n    Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of\ninterest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is\nexpected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks\nare under way.\n    \"I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,\nfor an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's\ndebt,\" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.\n    \"I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just\nhow long the run is is anybody's guess,\" Swearingen said.\n    Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium\nmay force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs\nand reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.\n    The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these\nloans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the\nContinental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,\nContinental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an\ninquiry.\n    Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net\nincome equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.\n    Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for\n1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.\nContinental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing\noffice rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.\n    In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a\nshare, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.\n    The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and\nother assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,\nduring 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the\n1984 restructuring agreement with the government.\n    The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it\nis entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,\nSwearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss\nrather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.\n    In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market\nrose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.\n    Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank\nwould like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it\nbought three small suburban banks.\n    Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be\ntaken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large\nenough to buy it, and New York money center banks are\nprohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.\n    He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who\nwill eventually own the firm because it still holds the\nequivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.\n    The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has\nsaid it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The\nagency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984\nbailout of the bank.\n    Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the\nstruggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry\nexecutive, said he will retire when the three-year period he\nagreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not\ncomment on a successor.\n    The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options\nclearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its\ndoubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country\ndoesn't need external sources of cash.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

(Jim)\nNugent told Reuters.\n     \"It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are\nseeing the bottom of the economic cycle,\" he added, \"and with\njust a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move\nagain.\"\n     The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil\nprices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to\nas low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to\naround 18 dlrs a barrel.\n     At the same time, a number of company executives testified\nthat the nation's domestic exploration and production segment\nwas still hurting and in need of government help.\n     Production costs are considerably higher in the United\nStates than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell\nmany domestic producers were forced to shut down their\noperations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs\noperating in the United States compared with an average of\nnearly 2,000 in 1985.\n     Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of\nEnergy, many said the falling production of domestic oil\ncoupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing\ndependency on imports, particularly from the politically\nvolatile Middle East.\n     \"In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower\nprices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day\n(bpd),\" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply\nDepartment at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil\ncompany.\n     At the same time, Simon said \"U.S. oil production declined\nby 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,\" and \"net\npetroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.\"\n     Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain\nbetween 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to\ncontrol production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at\n1986 levels, leading to \"a significant amount of spare\nworldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.\"\n     He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued\nvolatility and called for \"governmental and regulatory policies\nin support of the domestic petroleum industry.\"\n     Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal\ngovernment through the 1986 tax code changes and \"Superfund\"\nlegislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall\nprofits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access\nto federal lands for oil and gas exploration.\n     Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the\nindustry have called for as a way of building up the nation's\ndomestic operations before imports reach such a level that\nnational security might be compromised.\n     In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports\ncould make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that\nPersian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the\nfree world's total oil consumption by that date.\n     Arguing that \"oil is a political tool in every nation on\nearth,\" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called\nfor a variable oil import fee, among other measures, \"before\nthe treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and\nour national security is compromised.\"\n     Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,\nagreed, saying that like many federal government programs that\nwere set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a\n\"shambles.\"\n     Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.\n\"For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is\nover,\" he said.\n     Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining\nand Marketing Co, said he was \"enthusiastic about the future,\"\nadding that he expected \"an increase in profitability by\nmidyear.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later\ndevelopment of a generating unit.\n    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about\n877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  \"The\nhigher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would\nincrease the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with\nscrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.\"\n    A company spokesman said the company has already spent\nabout 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been\nmade of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does\nnot expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina\nPower intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings\nit will make late this year or early next year.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

New England Electric is the operator of this\nventure as well as owning 51 pct of the project.\n    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln\ndlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission\nlines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.\n    New England Electric said internally generated funds will\ncover all of its power plant construction costs this year and\n65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan\nto spend in 1987.\n    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on\nits oil and gas activities this year, adding internally\ngenerated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.\n    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs\nworth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional\nhigher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit\nplans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year\nas well.\n    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares\nthis year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise\nabout 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its\ndividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.\n    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the\nconstruction spending projection is based on the expectation\nthat demand for electricity in the New England electric system\nwill grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.\n    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for\nsharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2\npct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.\n    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices\nand a strong New England economy.\n    Huntington said New England Elecetric has \"all but rejected\nnew coal fired plants\" to supply additional power.\n    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those\nwith short lead times which can be built in modules.\n    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is\nlooking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply\nmost of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired\nfluidized bed units.\n    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in\nmodular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the\ntraditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The\nrest came from acquisitions, he said.\n    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,\na subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will\nnot make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.\n    He also said he is \"not very optimistic\" about the ongoing\nnegotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based\nchemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and\nU.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.\n    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the\nproposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the\nnext 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical\nwaste business through GSX Corp.\n    \"We feel it is a profitable business with good growth\npotential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right\nmanagement,\" de Groote said.\n    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.\nsubsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a\n200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.\n    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in\ncash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.\n    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will\nrepresent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will\ncontribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.\n    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing\nwell and there are no plans to sell it, he said.\n    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to\nearnings per share for the year. He also said that further\nacquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely\nwithin the next few months.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of\nfive commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.\n    \"For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns\nhave fallen well short of their cost of capital, however\ndefined,\" commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted\nwith the majority.\n    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the\nhighest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and\nOhio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3\npct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and\nthe Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.\n    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the\nDelaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the\nWestern Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Foreign\ncurrency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of\nbalance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.\n    Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business\nchiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is\neffectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped\nsome 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.\n    Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from\nthe bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said\nthat it came close to one mln stg.\n    On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct\nto 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed\n8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.\n    According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to\nlower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.\nWagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House\nEnergy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee\nresponsible for overseeing the SEC.\n    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and\nexplore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market\ndisruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual\ntrading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for\ntheir own account before placing customers' orders.\n    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the\nperception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the\npractice. The CME board responded with a plan that would\nrestrict, but not ban, the activity.\n    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from\nAustralia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and\nSingapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC\nproposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign\nfutures and options on U.S. exchanges.\n    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the\ngrounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.\n    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the\nexchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement\nstrict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to\nrevise federal limits on speculative positions and the\ndefinition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new\ninstruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of\nPurolator's U.S. courier business.\n    For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier\nbusiness represents an \"excellent financial investment\" in a\nmarket it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman\nEsther Szynkarsky said.\n    The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in\nEMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.\n    It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said\nthe two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and\nthe two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.\n    She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of\nseeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline\nbusiness.\n    Gelco will continue to operate with current management,\nindependently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already\noperates its own air cargo business that includes a small\ndoor-to-door courier operation.\n    \"They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing\nwell in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep\nit,\" Szynkarsky said.\n    Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units\nwill likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery\nnetwork, generating traffic for the former parent companies\nwithout them having to tie up capital in Canada.\n    \"The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is\nincremental revenue,\" Hine said.\n    \"It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in\nplace the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff\nthrough, the more money you make,\" he added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But it had indicated that consideration would be given\nin due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by\nAmalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.\n    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance\nof permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry\nfears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of\nreview and change, the press release said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and\nwas oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids.\n    The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were\nSanwa Bank Ltd, Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd, Dai-Ichi\nKangyo Bank Ltd, Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd, each with\ntranches of 100 mln dlrs, Shearson detailed.\n    The investment banking firm said another series of variable\nmoney market CDs is planned for April.\n    \"The variable money market CDs provide a low cost\ndependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks,\" said\nRobert Shapiro, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman\nCommercial Paper Inc. \"The instrument enables banks to\ndiversify their funding base in a significant way.\"\n    In yesterday's series, the issuing banks' coupon rates were\nset at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which\nis expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis\npoints, Shearson said.\n    The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be\nsubject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York\nFed's commercial paper composite rate.\n    Shearson stressed, however, that the spread over the\ncommercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be\ndetermined by investor demand. It added that other Japanese\nbanks may participate in future issues.\n    \"For the first time, they (the banks) will gain access not\nonly to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper\ninvestors at rates which are competitive with traditional\nfloating rate CDs,\" said Michael Balaban, a vice president with\nShearson's commercial paper unit.\n    He added, \"For U.S. investors, the CDs are attractive\nbecause they are domestically issued paper with competitive\nrates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks.\"\n    Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money\nmarket funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank\npaper submitted bids during yesterday's sale.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The U.S. Congress and the oil industry\nare deeply divided on ways the government should assist the\nindustry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the\nsubsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.\n    \"The industry is deeply divided between those who support an\noil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,\"\nsaid Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research\nAssociates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.\nCongress on energy issues.\n    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax\nincentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.\n    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will\npropose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural\ngas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for\nconsideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the\nproposal would be reviewed.\n    Herrington said, \"I would like to shoot for one mln barrels\na day (addition) to U.S. production.\" U.S. oil output was off to\n8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last\nyear, the American Petroleum Institute said.\n    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average\nabout 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a\nmove above that level will be unlikey for the near term.\n    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that\n\"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've\nonly altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for\nthe year.\"\n    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and\nexploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output\nwill not take place as the companies are waiting for stable\nprices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.\n    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry\nResearch Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to\nCongress said \"The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is\nvirtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But\nthe future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil\nprices and U.S. government policy.\"\n    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil\nproduction but would only work over time.\n    \"Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably\nbe a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but\nwould not raise energy costs.\" Lichtblau said.\n    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the\ndrilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief\nwhich could be brought on by an oil import fee.\n    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International\nAssociation of Drilling Contractors, said, \"The members of our\ntrade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil\nimport fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our\nnation.\" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil\nservice companies.\n    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee\nwill face a stiff uphill battle.\n    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by\na former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil\nimport fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a\nmeans of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.\n     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed\nopposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would\nhurt consumers and some regional interests.\n    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow\nif production continued to fall and imports to rise.\n    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements\n\"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above\nthat level, a fee may not be legislated but there will\ncertainly be pressure for some form of action.\"\n     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, \"a 50 pct\nrate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.\n    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy\nrequirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

There\nwas no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.\n    With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were\nable to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent\nweeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,\nsunflower and sorghum harvesting.\n    Crops were considered in generally good condition, though\nit is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of\nrecent weeks caused any long-term damage.\n    The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the\ntotal area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at\n3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85\nmln hectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Total production for the current maize harvest is expected\nto reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln\ntonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct\nlower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,\naccording to official figures.\n    The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of\ntotal planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two\nto 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record\n3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.\n    The current harvest's volume was again expected to be\nbetween 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than\nlast harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.\n    Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared\nthat heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on\ncrops and, consequently, on total production volume.\n    The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of\ntotal planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.\n    Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and\n1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln\nhectares planted in the previous harvest.\n    Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest\nremained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to\n22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln\ntonnes.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Treasury Secretary James Baker and\nFederal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker have told House\nleaders they were optimistic their debt strategy would work,\nbut acknowledged the crisis could take a sharp turn for the\nworse, Congressional sources and U.S. officials said.\n    Baker and Volcker gave these views at closed-door talks \nyesterday with Speaker Jim Wright and other House leaders.\n    But the two architects of the Third World debt strategy\ngave no indications they would abandon their plan to promote\neconomic growth and reform.\n    \"They expressed optimism about the current state of affairs,\"\none participant at the meeting said.\n    However Baker and Volcker, accompanied by Deputy Secretary\nof State John Whitehead, acknowledged there were risks. \"And if\nthings turned sour, they could turn very sour,\" a source quoted\nthem as saying.\n    They were responding to questions from Wright, a Texas\nDemocrat, who called the meeting two weeks ago because of his\nconcern the debt crisis was deepening, an aide said.\n    The Speaker asked all three men about the risks to Latin\nAmerican democracy and the danger that demagogues of either\nleft or right could wrest control and halt debt repayments.\n    Even though the Fed chief joined Baker in expressing more\nconfidence in an optimistic outcome, Volcker was especially\nconcerned about the political risks, and in particular the \nfatigue with belt-tightening. The central banker said resolving\nthe debt crisis would be a \"struggle\".\n    Since taking over the Speakership at the start of the year,\nWright has shown himself an able political adversary of the\nadministration on budget strategy.\n    His involvement in this issue also seems to signal that\nCongressional interest in the debt problem has to be taken more\nseriously now than in the past.\n    More worrisome for administration strategists is the\npossibility that Congressional debt proposals essentially\ngranting debt relief will be attached to a trade bill.\n    \"When (Baker and Volcker) left the Speaker's office, they\nknew it wasn't just talk,\" one source at the meeting said.\n    The two economic policymakers listened patiently to\ndescriptions of plans for a Third World debt facility, backed\nby gold reserves of the International Monetary Fund.\n    The agency could buy up or guarantee developing country\ndebt at a discount and resell it to debtor nations undertaking\neconomic reforms.\n    The U.S. Treasury would be required to ask other countries\nfor their views under a bill approved by a House Banking\nsubcommittee and sponsored by John LaFalce, a New York House\nDemocrat. A similar proposal is being fashioned by Bruce\nMorrison, a House Democrat from Connecticut.\n    The sources said House Banking and Foreign Affairs leaders\nalso attended the discussions.\n    U.S. officials said both schemes are regarded by the\nadministration as providing debt relief. Baker said yesterday\nthe concept of debt relief was misguided. \"If we write it all\noff and declare defeat, these countries will decay and wither\non the vine,\" the Treasury Secretary said of an end to capital\ninflows that would follow debt relief.\n    Baker has said his own plan was broad and would embrace new\ninnovative ideas bringing together debtors and creditors.\n    Baker and Volcker launched their in late 1985, calling on\ncommercial and multilateral banks to increase loans to major\ndebtors pursuing inflation-free expansion and open markets.\n    \"They sat down together to discuss the implications for\nLatin America and feel each other out on the best way out,\" a\nWright aide said of the meeting. Other sources said they expect\nthe dialogue to continue.\n    The talks come after Brazil's interest rate moratorium and\nan uncompromising stand by the country's finance minister,\nDilson Funaro, after talks with western leaders.\n    Some U.S. officials feel Funaro's consolidation of power\nover the Brazilian economy with the ouster of Planning minister\nJoao Sayad is further reason to worry.\n    Another proposal, to allow regulators to grant commercial\nbanks more flexibility in accounting for Third World loans, has\nbeen presented by Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,\nbut did not come up yesterday.\n    Wright, who has not hitherto concerned himself with debt,\n\"is concerned about the potential for damage. The Latin American\nissue, at least on the surface appears to be a new danger,\" said\nan aide, who asked not to be named.\n    There are signs the Brazilian situation and a reluctance by\ncommercial banks to join in new cash loans even for debtors\nfollowing substantial reforms has concerned U.S. officials.\n    At the State Department, Secretary of State George Shultz\nis being advised the \"Baker plan is going through a rough patch\"\nwhile Treasury officials are urging commercial banks to adopt\nmore flexible approaches to guarantee their continued\nparticipation in the plan.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Fleet Financial Group hopes its\nproposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the\nlargest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning\nof 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.\n    Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for\nRhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring\nthe possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date\nfor the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July\none. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.\n    The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that\nsaid the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be\nconsummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate\nbanking outside of New England come down. \"If we can consummate\nthe deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,\"\nLougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in\nthe Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other\nbanking institution in the state.\n    He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only\npermits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be\namended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.\n    If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,\nan option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase\nprovisions.\n    The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New\nYork as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled\nup by the money center giants.\n    Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet\nand Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of\ninterstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain\npermitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.\nSupreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.\n    Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed\nmerger as \"a partnership of two companies.\" Both will continue\nto operate existing headquarters after the merger.\n    Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one\nof theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one\nsplit. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the\ndeal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.\n    That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based\nSecurity Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion\n&lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is\nworth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.\n    Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas\nCommerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion\ndlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer\ndeal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>\nand Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs\nand there have been several bank mergers in the southeast\nvalued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.\n    \"It's a merger of equals,\" said analyst John Rooney of\nMoseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at\nthe end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book\nvalue was 28.02 dlrs.\n    Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his\n60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said\nKiernan would probably head the combined company until his\nretirement then Murray could assume the top post.\n    Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said\nFleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986\non the basis of the merger terms announced today.\n    He noted that Fleet has a \"teriffic reputation\" after\nhaving diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has\nestablished consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an\ninnovator in securitization of mortgages.\n    The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion\ndlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar\noperates in most of New York state but not in New York City.\n    Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations\nthat both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would\nbe combined.\n    The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a\n\"lock-up\" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each\ngranted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued\nshares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares\noutstanding.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

A building\nin land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3,300 dlrs a meter.\n    But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply\nincreases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach\nof foreign investors.\n    Japanese investors, spurred by the yen's rise, are spending\nrecord sums on property abroad, partly elsewhere in Asia, but\nin particular in the U.S., Where Japanese investment could\ndouble this year to 10 billion dlrs, the analysts said.\n    The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will\nrise steadily over the next few years, although a surge in\nconstruction will limit increases in some areas.\n    Property sales have become increasingly popular because in\nsome sectors of the market real estate prices, as in several\ncities in the region, have already outpaced rent yields.\n    \"We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see\nwhy the trend should not continue over the next few months,\"\nsaid Gareth Williams, a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong.\nBut he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk\nlinked to the return of the colony to China in 1997.\n    In several other countries, analysts predicted at least\nsome rise in property values, which in one or two cases, such\nas Thailand, could help spark a construction boom.\n    Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least\nseven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a\nresult of government assistance, low mortgage rates and a\ngenerally bullish economic outlook.\n    Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the\noutlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump, one\nPhilippine developer said.\n    Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after\nfive years in the doldrums, according to property developers in\nTaipei. They, like counterparts in many of the region's\ncapitals, cited low interest rates as a major factor.\n    One leading broker said the property market had become an\nattractive investment in Taiwan, noting property development\nyields of up to 15 pct.\n    Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers. Construction\nhas helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s,\nthough foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on\nproperty ownership, as in many parts of Asia.\n    In contrast, Australia's easing of rules on foreign\ninvestment in property, combined with financial deregulation\nand a weaker dollar, has helped spark overseas interest in the\nmarket, analysts said. But this has not always meant sales.\n    \"What we have seen is an increase in inquiries, particularly\nfrom Japan, but this has yet to show itself in many new deals\nbeing done,\" said Allan Farrar, executive director (real estate)\nof Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group.\n    Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 6.5 pct,\nand one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after\n15 pct rises in each of the past two years.\nREUTER...\n&#3;",

But the past five years of declining\nrevenue have taken their toll. Economists estimate gross\ndomestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985.\n    Oil revenue last year, when prices briefly dipped below 10\ndlrs per barrel, probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion\ndlrs, compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981.\n    \"Austerity is still the watchword, but Saudi Arabia will not\nbe allowed to dip further into recession ... The Saudis can\nafford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst\neffects,\" a diplomat said.\n    In the short-term, the kingdom can lessen the impact of\nlower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on\nforeign reserves, still put at around 100 billion dlrs.\n    But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely. Bankers\nand diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in\nthe longer term.\n    It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a\ntime when the government is publicly urging private enterprise\nto take over the lead role in the economy.\n    Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of\nthe risks attached to this policy but is determined to \"tough it\nout\" on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion\nof reserves.\n    The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion\nriyals or 31 pct of total outlay. The budget explicitly\nrecognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign\nborrowing has been ruled out.\n    Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi\nbusinessmen this week the government had carefully considered\nthe need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget\nplans late last year.\n    \"It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50\nbillion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the\neconomy,\" he said.\n    Reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early\n1980's when Saudi Arabia's breakneck pace of construction and\ntales of high spending became legendary.\n    The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the\nfabric of the Kingdom's private sector where poor management\nhad gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom.\n    Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced,\nmarkets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut\nback. The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply.\n    The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but\nSaudi banks, hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate\nsector, have become highly selective in extending new credit.\n    Government moves to encourage lending and investigate\ncompany complaints about late public sector contract payments\ncould boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's\nindustrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment.\n    Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and\nmore cash being placed on deposit.\n    As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic\ndevelopment from the public to the private sector, one of the\nbiggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel\npersonal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom\nand refrain from the temptation to invest abroad.\n REUTER\n&#3;",
