It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party\nwith a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the\nfast-improving centrist Alliance.\n    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in\nJune, Sir Marcus Fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922\ncommittee of Conservative back-benchers, said: \"I have always\nfelt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.\n    \"I always thought June was right. We have got most of our\nlegislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would\nbe in the national interest.\"\n    Another Tory back-bencher, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, said: \"I\nhave always been an October man, but I think it would be good\nto get it out of the way now.\"\n    Their comments came as government officials dismissed\nspeculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls\nin May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent\npopularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and\nLabour's current popularity slump.\n    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern\nover a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility that\nif it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall\nmajority in parliament.\n    Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points\nover the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the\noutcome of the next election is likely to be decided.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The records in turnover set by the London\nInternational Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) in March could\nbe surpassed in the coming months, Liffe Chief Executive\nMichael Jenkins said.\n    Last month, Liffe saw record monthly futures volume at 1.15\nmln lots, and record monthly options volume at 97,700. Total\nLiffe volume in first quarter 1987 rose to 2.8 mln contracts,\nor 89 pct up on the same 1986 period.\n    Long gilt turnover in first quarter 1987 was 300 pct up on\nthe year-ago period at 1.63 mln lots versus 409,500. But T-bond\nvolume fell by 38 pct to 244,500 in first three months 1987.\n    Jenkins told Reuters the higher volumes for gilts reflected\nin part the volatility in the U.K. Markets in recent months,\nwhile the falloff in T-bonds was an indication of the relative\nstability of U.S. Credit markets.\n    Jenkins said he saw room for the whole financial futures\nsector to grow further in the coming months. In particular, FT-\nSE 100 futures had great scope for expansion, and turnover in\nthem should be much higher by end 1987.\n    FT-SE futures volume was 62,700 in first quarter 1987, an\nincrease of 124 pct over the 28,000 contracts recorded in the\nsame months of 1986.\n    Institutions here had been slow to find out about the use\nof stock exchange futures, but they would now learn more,\nJenkins predicted.\n    Commenting on the difference in popularity between gilts\nand bonds, Jenkins said Liffe had designed the widest possible\nvariety of contracts so that at any given time, at least one\nsector would be volatile enough to attract trading. The current\nsituation of U.S. Markets being steady, and U.K. Ones\nchangeable, might alter completely in coming months.\n    A further boost to Liffe's volume and attractiveness should\ncome with the introduction of yen bond futures, he added.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This\nincludes leasing and is the equivalent of 19 pct of all\noutstanding loans by the banking sector at end-1986.\n    Ogren said that if proposals now being discussed by a\ngovernment-appointed inquiry into the credit market to license\nfinance companies and make them increase their share capital\nwere pushed through, up to 70 pct would disappear.\n    But he said this would in fact have little effect on credit\nvolumes as the 42 biggest finance companies accounted for 70\npct of lending by the entire sector.\n    The explosive growth of Swedish finance companies began in\nthe early 1970s and commercial banks even started their own to\nget around the tight restrictions then imposed on banking\nactivities and particularly on the growth of lending.\n    Now that they were on an equal footing with their parent\ncompanies, many bank-owned finance companies faced an identity\ncrisis, Ogren said. He predicted there would be mergers and\nindividual firms would carve out specialised niches to ensure\ntheir survival in a deregulated climate.\n    Ogren said the sector's losses on bad loans were bound to\nrise steeply in 1989-1990 due to the rush to increase credit.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

U.S. computer makers\nthat use the chips in their machines will then be pressured.\n    \"The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade\npressures from Washington, but at the same time they're\ndemonstating their muscle,\" analyst Peck said.\n    The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to\nbenefit U.S. chip makers.\n    \"I think this could be a very important factor for U.S.\nsemiconductor manufacturers,\" industry analyst Elliot Levine of\nLadenburg Thalmann Co said.\n    But analyst Peck said, \"it will take a few weeks to see\nwhether Japan has genuinely cut production.\"\n    He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's\nrequest unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and\nproduction cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in\nplant and equipment.\n\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He also said that currency changes\nthat have occurred so far should be large enough -- in a\ncontext of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the\nU.S. -- to support expectations for a narrower U.S. trade gap.\n    \"There was nothing new or remarkable there,\" said a dealer\nat one European bank. The dollar's brief rise to 1.8270 marks\nwas already underway when Volcker spoke, he added.\n    With the dollar becalmed, dealers looked to cross-rates,\nespecially sterling, yen and Swiss franc, for interest.\n    Sterling continued to benefit from U.K. public opinion\npolls indicating a lead for the ruling Conservative party in\nany general election and following signals of an improved\neconomy.\n    The pound hovered at 1.6175/85 dlrs, unchanged from Monday,\nand at 2.955 marks, off slightly from about 2.955 last night.\n    The dollar eased to 1.5120/30 Swiss francs from 1.5180/90,\nand to 1.3048/53 Canadian dollars from 1.3080/85 yesterday.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis\npoints lower to one basis point higher.\n    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32\nto yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.\n    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul\nVolcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to\nnarrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,\nsizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little\nexchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his\nviews.\n    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under\npressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations\nmeet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.\n    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the\nsession on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but\nthat otherwise there was little activity in this sector.\n    \"When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it\nmakes people think the Fed is not going to tighten,\" a bill\ntrader said. \"But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers.\"\n    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points\nbelow their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills\nrose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.\n    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.\n    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply\ntemporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect\ninjection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a\ndirect injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed\nconducted at its usual intervention time.\n    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8\npct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,\ndown from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.\n    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at\nmidday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the\ndefinition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which\nis \"a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,\"\nGene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.\n    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying\nUSDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty\nprovision, farm industry sources said.\n    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said\nlivestock producers were \"desperate\" because they fear they will\nbe unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined\nthat industry.\n    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986\nimmigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress\ndid not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers\nwho helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and\nSpanish reeds was \"marginal.\"\n    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration\nof the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the\nthe amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees\n\"a tough call,\" this source said.\n    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation\nexcept to say it was subject to change before it will be\nreleased, probably some time later this month.\n    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under\nconsideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is\nnot likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration\nquestion, congressional sources said.\n    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers\nwas crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.\n    Congressional staff members estimate the special farm\nworker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to\n350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who\nworked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply\nfor temporary, then permanent, resident status.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He suggested direct participation of the\ngovernments of creditor countries in debt talks.\n    In negotiations on commercial debt, talks have\ntraditionally been restricted to banks.\n    The creation of the new commission brings Brazil's highly\nprofessional Foreign Ministry much more into the forefront on\nthe debt issue than it has been in the past.\n    During the period of military rule, which ended in 1985,\nthe Foreign Ministry played a very minor role in debt policy.\n    But the new commission has diplomats among its members and\nthe chief negotiator, Saraiva Guerreiro, is a seasoned envoy\nwith a long diplomatic career.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Attorneys\nrepresenting Texaco were not immediately available.\n    The filing follows yesterday's decision by the U.S. Supreme\nCourt, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cut\nTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs. The high court ruled that\nthe issue should first be considered by Texas state courts.\n    Texaco yesterday said it would soon file to prevent\nenforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it would\nmake the filing in a District Court, the Court of Appeals or\nthe Texas Supreme Court.\n    Jeffers said Texaco chose the Appeals Court because it\ncurrently has jurisdiction in the case.\n    According to Texas state law, Texaco could be forced to\npost the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it failed\nto do so, Pennzoil could seek liens on Texaco's assets for the\namount of the judgement.\n    Texaco's filing contains a request to cut the amount of the\nbond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, Jeffers said. Asked\nwhat Pennzoil's thought of that amount, he said, \"I don't think\nit's enough.\"\n    Pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to force\nTexaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form of\na bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security.\n    \"We've recognized there are other alternatives to a bond,\"\nJeffers, the Pennzoil attorney, said.\n    Pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filing\nbut Jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made.\n    The dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil stems from the 1984\ntakeover of Getty Oil Co by Texaco. Pennzoil said the merger\nviolated a prior agreement it had to buy Getty and sued Texaco.\nSince then, Pennzoil's position has twice been upheld by Texas\nState Courts. The Judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs,\nincluding interest, and is on appeal.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Brazil's financial crisis is rapidly\nbecoming a political and social crisis, and President Jose\nSarney faces increasingly serious questions about his future.\n    As Brazil enters debt talks with creditors in the United\nStates this week, political analysts say Sarney's\nadministration has never appeared weaker.\n    The full political price which Sarney will have to pay for\nthe failure of the much-vaunted anti-inflation Cruzado Plan is\nstill not clear. He might have to pay with the presidency.\n    Calls are increasing for direct presidential elections to\npick a successor to Sarney early next year. The length of his\nterm will be decided by a Constituent Assembly, and Sarney has\nbeen lobbying for a six-year term.\n    Sarney came to power, without facing presidential\nelections, in March 1985, when the military bowed out after 21\nyears of rule.\n    Although there was wide public support for direct \nelections for president, the military as one of their last\nacts, insisted an electoral college, where it felt it had more\ninfluence, make the choice.\n    The college chose Tancredo Neves, a popular politician who\nheaded the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), which\nhad opposed military rule.\n    In part to smooth relations with the military, Neves chose\nSarney, a supporter of the generals, for the purely ceremonial\npost of vice-president. But Neves died before he could take\noffice and Sarney took power.\n    He won the grudging support of the PMDB and the Cruzado\nPlan was wildly popular with inflation-weary Brazilians.\n    But the Cruzado Plan failed and politics in Brazil has not\nbeen the same.\n    \"The country is a rudderless ship,\" said a U.S. Diplomat,\nechoing a common view that the government lacks any clear idea\nof how to tackle the economic crisis.\n    Sarney has appeared increasingly isolated, with criticism\ncoming from the business community, the trade unions, some of\nthe military, the media and political opponents.\n    Many businessmen are unhappy with Sarney's decision\nannounced on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68\nbillion dlrs of foreign debt.\n    A motor industry executive said: \"The business community\nthinks Brazil should go to the IMF. Their rules are sometimes\nharsh and strict, but this is the only way to put the house in\norder.\"\n    Trade unions generally support the debt moratorium, but\ndisagree with other aspects of government policy. Since the end\nof February they have organized national strikes of seamen,\nbankworkers and federal university teachers and countless local\nstoppages and protests.\n    Economic problems have prompted criticism from some\nmilitary figures, including the last army ruler, General Joao\nFigueiredo. It is a sign of the times that almost daily\nmilitary men deny there is going to be a coup.\n    If the army does stay in the barracks, the key arbitors of\nSarney's fate will be the PMDB's leaders. So far, they have not\ntaken a clear stand on the issue of direct elections.\n    But one PMDB leader, Senator Affonso Camargo, pointedly\nsaid yesterday that it was the sovereign right of the\nConsituent Assembly to call direct elections for the presidency\nwhenever it wished.\n    In the media, Sarney has to contend with strong criticism.\n    One senior political commentator, Fernando Pedreira of the\nJornal do Brasil, wrote in the newspaper last week:\n    \"President Sarney is ... a man of good intentions, but it\nis just possible that he himself is not aware of the true state\nof the country and the people since the immense failure of the\nCruzado Plan.\n    \"The disappointment, the frustration, the irritation, the\nenticement have been (and continue to be) too great, too\nprofound.\"He called for direct elections early in 1988 as the\nonly way out of the present crisis.\n    One of Sao Paulo's leading news magazines, Senhor, said in\nan editorial this week: \"The anarcho-populist government of\nPresident Jose Sarney has failed. Two years have already been\ntoo long for such a disastrous experience.\n    \"It deserves to be buried as quickly as possible. The\nnatural solution: direct elections soon.\"\n    The government's inability to control inflation is now\nbringing with it serious social problems.\n    An explosion in rents in Sao Paulo has thrown tens of\nthousands of families onto the streets because they can no\nlonger afford to pay even for a wooden shack in the slums.\n    The local press says the city is experiencing the biggest\nwave of land invasions in its history.\n   According to rental agencies, rents have increased 500 pct\nin little more than a year. Even the cheapest shacks now cost\n2,000 cruzados (90 dollars) a month, half as much again as the\nminimum wage, which is all that many earn.\n    Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, the Roman Catholic archbishop\nof Sao Paulo, warned yesterday of the possibility of \"a social\nconflict of unimaginable proportions.\"\n    With his back to the wall politically and with social\ntensions rising, Sarney is no position to compromise on debt.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Against the mark,\nthe dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180\nin Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.\n    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially\ncatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.\n    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be \"large\nenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal\nrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a\nnarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.\"\n    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. \"It\nwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as\na defender of the currency,\" said one trader.\n    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance\nMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long\nconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this\nafternoon.\n    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for\ncurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role\nthe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to\nprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.\n    \"Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only\nperson who will make a difference is Baker,\" said Alan Rose of\nFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.\n    \"The key question for the currency market is whether the\n(Reagan) administration will have a change of view on the\ndollar. If not, the dollar is going lower,\" he added.\n    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen\nwas linked to the market's perception that Washington was\nunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances\nand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least\ndisruptive way of accelerating the process.\n    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of\nattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh\npositions until later in the week.\n    \"We are reserving judgement for the time being,\" said Doug\nMadison of Commerzbank Ag.\n    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling\ntrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at\n1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.\n    However, underyling sentiment remains positive after a U.K.\nopinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest\npopularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.\n    \"Sterling still seems to be on the firm side,\" said one\ndealer.\n    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger\ntone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from\n1.3080/85 yesterday.\n    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,\nthe dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below\naverage market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct\nyesterday.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

About the same\ntime, says analyst Khaled Abdel Majeed, Drexel issued a buy\nrecommendation on the West german automaker BMW.\n    He says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for\n1987 and 1988. \"The company trades in Germany on the parent\ncompany's earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, the\nmultiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors.\"\n    By contrast Jaguar's share price to earnings multiple is\nabout 12 and Daimler-Benz AG is around 14 or 15.\n    Drexel analyst Lucille Palermo recently upgraded\nrecommendations on some Canadian gold stocks. With no recession\nin sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buying\ninterest from the Middle East. Also, expectation of a higher\ninflation rate stimulates demand.\n    On the supply side she thinks \"people are overlooking the\nproblems in South Africa.\"  Palermo says all of this will push\nthe bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.\n    Her current buy recommendations are Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd\n&lt;AEAGF>, American Barrick Resources Corp &lt;ABX>, and Echo Bay\nMines Ltd &lt;ECO>.\n    Palermo also believes the overall Canadian stock market has\ngreater potential this year than last. Although the Canadian\ndollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of several\nyears ago. \"Canadian exports of all types look relatively cheap\nto foreigners - resources, manufactured goods, bonds and\nstocks.\"\n    Other European stocks favored by Drexel include Club\nMediterranee &lt;CMI>, Pernod-Ricard, Royal Dutch Petroleum &lt;RD>,\nUnilever &lt;UN>, British Petroleum Co plc &lt;BP> and Imperial\nChemical Industries plc &lt;ICI>. Drexel cautions U.S. investors\nthat foreign dividends may be subject to withholding tax.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Monday's\nreport that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for\nexport last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack\nof farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders\nsaid.\n    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.\n    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many\nfarmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather\nthan marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales\nhave been lighter than expected this week.\n    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but\nprices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as\nspeculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.\n    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength\nrelated to tight supplies.\n    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains\npast three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat\npackers to bid aggressively for available animals.\n    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after\nthe extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract\nsoar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start\nof the year.\n    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil\nwould not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The long bond seems\nheaded for eight pct within the next few days,\" a trader said.\nThat would correspond to a price of about 94-3/8.\n    Treasury bill rates increased two to eight basis points.\nNotes prices declined 1/8 to 3/4.\n    Bond traders said the main negative is recent instability\nof the dollar and growing feeling that even concerted central\nbank support will not be able to prevent a further sharp\ndecline in the U.S. currency.\n    The dollar came under mild downward pressure early and\nfinished with modest net losses. The currency was largely\nunaffected by generally supportive comments by Federal Reserve\nChairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi\nMiyazawa.\n    Miyazawa once again said he and Treasury Secretary James\nBaker agree on the need for stable foreign exchange rates.\n    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told Congress that the dollar's\nfall thus far should be \"large enough, in a context of a\ngrowing world economy and fiscal restraint in the U.S., to\nsupport widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real\ntrade deficit in the period ahead.\"\n    Despite favorable comments by Volcker and Miyazawa, there\nappears to be broad agreement among currency and bond market\nparticipants that a huge Federal budget deficit and a wide,\nalthough narrowing, trade gap will further depress the dollar.\nThat could mean Japanese and other foreign investors will buy\nfewer U.S. bonds or even start selling them.\n    There has been no evidence of large-scale sales of U.S.\nbonds by the Japanese. Some dealers said that these investors\nactually purchased a modest amount of U.S. debt today, but they\nfocused on shorter maturities in the two-year area rather than\non long bonds.\n    To the extent that overseas investors back away from the\nU.S. bond market, dealers said that higher yields will be\nneeded to lure others to take their place.\n    A late Federal funds rate rise contributed slightly to the\nbond market retreat. After averaging 6.20 pct yesterday, funds\nopened at 6-1/8 pct and traded between 6-1/16 and 6-1/4 pct.\n    The Federal funds rate rise occurred despite the Fed's\nunexpected direct supply of temporary reserves. The Fed\narranged two-day System repurchase agreements with funds\ntrading at 6-1/8 pct.\n    Treasury bill rates increased largely in response to the\nhigher funds rate. Rates on new three and six-month bills rose\ntwo and seven basis points from Monday's auction averages to\nclose at 5.55/54 pct and 5.70/69 pct. Year bills at 5.81/80 pct\nwere up eight basis points from yesterday's close.\n    Among notes, the 6-3/8s of 1989 dropped 1/8 to 99-9/16,\nwith the 7-1/4s of 1996 down 3/4 at 97-3/8.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Against the mark,\nthe dollar finished at 1.8270/80 marks after falling to 1.8180\nin Europe and ending at 1.8260/70 here yesterday.\n    In Congressional testimony this morning, Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker harped on his long-held fears about the potentially\ncatastrophic fallout from a sharp dollar decline.\n    He also said the dollar's fall, thus far, should be \"large\nenough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal\nrestraint in the U.S., to support widespread expectations of a\nnarrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead.\"\n    The market impact of Volcker's comments was minimal. \"It\nwas the same old story. Volcker was just fulfilling his role as\na defender of the currency,\" said one trader.\n    The market was similarly dismissive of Japanese Finance\nMinister Kiichi Miyazawa's upbeat appraisal of his hour-long\nconversation with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker this\nafternoon.\n    Miyazawa said that they both agreed on the need for\ncurrency stabilization and that he was satisfied with the role\nthe U.S. has played in coordinated international efforts to\nprop up the dollar since the late February Paris agreement.\n    \"Miyazawa can talk until he's blue in the face. The only\nperson who will make a difference is Baker,\" said Alan Rose of\nFirst Interstate Bank in Los Angeles.\n    \"The key question for the currency market is whether the\n(Reagan) administration will have a change of view to the\ndollar. If not, the dollar is going lower,\" he added.\n    The dollar's recent tumble to a 40-year low of 144.70 yen\nwas linked to the market's perception that Washington was\nunhappy with the rate of adjustment of world trade imbalances\nand that a continued orderly dollar decline was the least\ndisruptive way of accelerating the process.\n    While most analysts do not expect any marked change of\nattitude in Washington, they were reluctant to open any fresh\npositions until later in the week.\n    \"We are reserving judgement for the time being,\" said Doug\nMadison of Commerzbank Ag.\n    The tranquility of the dollar market spread to sterling\ntrading today. The pound ended unchanged against the dollar at\n1.6175/85 and edged up to 2.957 marks from 2.955 yesterday.\n    However, underlying sentiment remains positive after a U.K.\nopinion poll gave the ruling Conservative party its highest\npopularity rating since it was re-elected in 1983.\n    \"Sterling still seems to be on the firm side,\" said one\ndealer.\n    The Canadian currency also retained a generally stronger\ntone, rising to 1.3055/60 to its U.S. counterpart from\n1.3080/85 yesterday.\n    According to figures provided by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co,\nthe dollar's trade-weighted value at midday was 5.7 pct below\naverage market rates in 1980-82, compared with 5.5 pct\nyesterday.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The State of Texas, faced with a record\n5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may\nhave to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.\n     Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when\nthe state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily\nallowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate\nincome tax.\n     However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only\nsent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into\nthe state's tax revenues.\n    Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cut\ntheir credit ratings of the state to double A from the top\ntriple A in early March.\n    Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was the\nfirst time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding\nthe report noted that while \"the Legislature is now considering\nproposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for\nfull recovery are weak.\"\n    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State\nComptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapple\nwith a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8\nbillion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No other\nstate in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.\n    \"There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five\nyears ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature\nwould institute an income tax,\" said George Bland, Assistant\nProfessor of Political Science at North Texas State University,\nadding, \"Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it's\ncoming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time.\"\n     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally\nsupplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.\n    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent\nyears, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence\non sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.\n     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major\nfactor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are\nno longer deductible from federal income tax while state income\ntax is.\n    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based\nTexas Research League said, \"There is a great deal of popular\nsentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor\nClements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax.\"\n    However, he said that since the oil price fall the state\nfaced a choice of either instituting an income tax or\nbroadening and possibly raising the sales tax.\n    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise\nat Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,\nsaid he favored reforming the present tax system to take\naccount of the changed structure of the economy.\n    \"We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil\nand agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,\nmanufacturing and high-tech,\" Pejovich said.\n    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock\nsaid, \"Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the\nLegislature that if they get tired of looking at everything\nelse, that's the only option.\"\n    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income\ntax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,\nWashington and Wyoming \n    For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled\nthat the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr\ndeficit into the next biennium, even though the state\nconsitution requires a balanced budget. But as State Treasurer\nAnn Richards said last Thursday, \"Jim Mattox's decision today\nturns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not\nthink that the goose isn't still cooking.\"\n    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending\ncuts. But the state is already under pressure from a Federal\nDistrict Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or\nface 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.\n    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accused\nthe state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier this\nyear, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial\nrestraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning\nplans to require teachers to take competency tests.\n    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission\nnext year to \"study alternative revenue sources,\" with an\nincome tax being instituted as early as January 1989.\n    \"If the political leaders are educated about (the effects\nof the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift\ntoward income tax,\" he said.\n                \n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7\nfinance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key\nto the direction of currency futures at the International\nMonetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond\nthe Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial\nanalysts said.\n    \"If they (the finance ministers) give the market something\nreally new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond\nthe Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the\ndollar,\" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.\n    On the other hand, \"anything neutral would tend to be\nbearish for the dollar,\" Mills said.\n    Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the\nParis accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the\ndollar, nor will central bank intervention.\n    \"A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies\nand sell the dollar,\" said one trader for a large retail firm\non the floor of the IMM.\n    \"If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking\nto sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,\" he\nsaid.\n    Technically, most currency futures are poised for another\nrise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.\n    Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high\non Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June\nsterling set a new contract high on Monday.\n    \"Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you\ndon't need much to get things rolling,\" Sloane said.\n    In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane\nrecently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range\nbetween 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle\non the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.\n    A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a\nbreakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby\nCanadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the\n0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.\n    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials\nbetween Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed\ndramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds\nonly about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.\n    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an\nincreasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the\nCanadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.\n    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near\nthe top of their long-term rally.\n    \"Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to\ncalm people,\" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.\n    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European\ncurrencies will trade, Horner said.\n    But sterling futures may still make another run for new\nhighs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the\npositive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections\nand possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June\nBritish pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.\n    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of\nthe yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.\n    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar\nbetween 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152\nyen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's\nrange would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June\ncontract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.\n    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, \"we will\nhave one more rally in the yen,\" Horner said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But we must be very careful,\" he said.\n    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's\ntrade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as\nthe United States.\n    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary\nofficials of major industrialized countries, saying the\nimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange\nrates had been underestimated.\n    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the\nright level, and that further changes would damage growth, he\nsaid.\n    \"This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the\npart of our American colleagues,\" he said.\n    But he said there was still a danger that the correction of\nthe dollar's value could overshoot.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

It finished at\n145.60/70 in New York and 145.15/20 here yesterday.\n    Dealers said the dollar appeared to be holding comfortably\nabove the critical 145 yen level now as yesterday's attempt to\nbreak that level failed for lack of momentum. But the markets\ngenerally are not expecting much from the Washington talks\ntoday, they added.\n    The dollar is expected to stay within a tight range today\nwith considerable selling pressure at the 145.60 yen and 1.8270\nmark levels, dealers said.\n    Dealers said supportive remarks yesterday from Federal\nReserve chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese Finance Minister\nKiichi Miyazawa were ignored as players squared positions.\n    Volcker told a Congressional committee the dollar's fall so\nfar should be \"large enough ... To support widespread\nexpectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the\nperiod ahead.\"\n    Miyazawa, after meeting Treasury Secretary James Baker,\nsaid they agreed on the need for currency stabilization and\nthat he was satisfied with the role the U.S. Has played in\nsupporting the dollar since the February Paris accord.\n    Sterling opened at 1.6182/92 dlrs against New York's\n1.6175/85 close and the 1.6200/10 finish here yesterday.\n    Dealers said sterling sentiment remains positive as the\nruling Conservative party maintained its lead in opinion polls.\nBut they said technical selling may depress it to 1.6150.\n    The Hong Kong dollar opened at 7.8005/25 against its U.S.\nCounterpart compared with yesterday's 7.8015/35 close.\n    Local interest rates tended easier with overnight opening\nat four 3-1/2 pct against yesterday's 4-1/2 four pct close.\n    Asian dollar rates were steady with three months opening\nunchanged at 6-1/2 3/8 pct.\n    The dollar started at 1.5147/57 Swiss francs against New\nYork's 1.5145/55 close and the 1.5137/47 finish here yesterday,\nand at 6.0690/0720 French francs against 6.0780/0810 and\n6.0600/20.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But other businessmen said such\na short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\nfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n    \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\ndirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n    \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\nbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\nis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,\naccounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\ntalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\nIndustry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n    \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\ncountries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\nserious matter,\" Button said.\n    He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,\nAustralia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant\nU.S. Exports to that country.\n    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\ntrade stand-off continue.\n    Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\na package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\nand record public works spending in the first half of the\nfinancial year.\n    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\nmeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.\n    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\nKuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\neffort to end the dispute.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Others argue the merger\nwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branch\nnetwork from scratch.\n    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has\nexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business\nand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the\nwisdom of some of those moves.\n    \"They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now\nit's largely out of their hands,\" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd\nfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.\n    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to\nenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American\ninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5\npct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at\nleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange\npersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.\n    \"The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the\nFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,\" said one analyst.\n    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.\n    \"U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,\nwe can do various things. We only have to wait two or three\nyears, not until the 21st century,\" Komatsu said.\n    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes\ninto the securities business at home.\n    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's\nversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial\nfrom investment banking.\n    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu\nsaid he hopes further deregulation will create new\nopportunities.\n    \"We need to find new business chances,\" Komatsu said. \"In some\ncases these will be securities related, in some cases trust\nbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.\"\n    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such\ndomestic securities business as profitable government bond\ndealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co\nLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.\n    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering\nthe securities business here through its Swiss universal bank\nsubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.\n     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to\nsecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,\nfollowing a similar decision for subsidiaries of European\nuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.\n    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar\ndecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.\n    \"We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed\nin two or three years,\" he said.\n    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand\nlending to individuals and small and medium businesses to\nreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.\n    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of\ntime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the\nmerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.\n    \"It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,\" said\nKleinwort's Smithson.\n    \"After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling\naround. It will be the next decade before we see if the\nstrategy is right or wrong.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Two\nfurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.\n    The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6\nand 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that\nrange are possible, dealers said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Thailand's improving economy may have\nhelped its trade and finance position but it has also created\nmajor problems for local banks, Thai and foreign bankers said.\n    They said a 900 mln dlr saving from cheaper imported oil\nand 19.7 pct export growth last year contributed to the\ncountry's first current account surplus in 20 years.\n    But the bright picture, together with a government program\nto help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices, coincides\nwith sluggish investment by a private sector still feeling the\nlingering effects of the 1984-86 recession.\n    Thai banks have had growing surplus funds and difficulties\nfinding borrowers since the third quarter of 1986.\n    Kunthon Narkprom, head of the budget and planning division\nof Thai Farmers Bank Ltd, estimated excess liquidity in banks\npeaked last month at 60 billion baht, three times what he\nconsidered normal. Bank of Thailand figures show total deposits\nin 1986 grew 12.7 pct to 627.7 billion baht, while lending rose\nonly 3.4 pct to 548.6 billion.\n    The lending/deposit ratio, which measures bank loans as a\npercentage of deposits, fell to 86.6 pct last month, the lowest\nsince the 1970s, after averaging 96.6 pct in 1985.\n    Thai banks have cut lending and deposit rates a record six\ntimes since January 1986, during which time the average minimum\nloan rate fell to 11.5 pct from 15.5 and the gross one-year\nfixed deposit rate to 7.25 pct from 11.\n    Five banks announced last week they would cut their maximum\nlending rates to small borrowers by one percentage point to 14\npct.\n    Kunthon of Thai Farmers estimated banks now have a combined\n80 billion baht unused overdraft line as many small and\nmedium-size companies delay borrowing in anticipation of more\ncuts in interest rates.\n    The record liquidity has seriously hurt the profits of\nbanks, which have been forced to invest idle funds in low-yield\ngovernment securities.\n    Kunthon said the banks hold four to 10 billion baht in\nshort-term government bonds bought through the Bank of\nThailand's bond repurchase facility, double the normal amount.\n    Thailand's 16 local commercial banks registered one of\ntheir worst years in 1986, with overall profits falling over 30\npct after a 14 pct decline in 1985.\n    Kunthon said profits should increase 10 pct this year as\nthe banks adjust to the new interest rate structure.\n    Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice president of Siam\nCommercial Bank Ltd, told reporters last week the liquidity\nproblem stems partly from the fact most loan demands come from\nbusinesses seeking funds for small, labour-intensive projects.\n    He said there are few large, capital-intensive projects and\nmany borrowers go offshore to meet their requirements.\n    Somboon Chinsavananond, Thai Farmers' fund management\nexecutive, said liquidity has been aggravated by the central\nbank's policy of fixing a stable baht-dollar exchange rate\nwhich permits Thai companies to import dollar-denominated funds\nwith a minimal risk of currency exchange losses.\n    He said underlying bearishness towards the U.S. Dollar has\nencouraged foreign borrowers who hope to pay less on loan\nprincipal when their loans mature.\n    Thai bankers said central bank governor Kamchorn Sathirakul\nlast month rejected a request to increase a 10 pct withholding\ntax on interest on foreign loans, a measure they said would\nreduce foreign borrowings. The governor replied the bankers\nshould extend more loans to rural areas instead.\n    Bankers said some Thai banks have offered credit-worthy\nclients loans at near money market rates of seven to eight pct\nin a bid to compete with foreign funds.\n    A market analyst at Siam Commercial Bank said bank lending\nat such rates amount to about 15 pct of all loans extended by\nthe industry.\n    A foreign banker, who requested anonymity, said the\n\"segmented market approach\" used by Thai banks for setting\ndifferent lending rates has caused dislocation of funds in the\nfinancial sector, eroded bank profits and prevented banks from\ntaking a more logical move of further cutting interest rates.\n    He said the liquidity problem gives the Bank of Thailand a\nperfect opportunity to assert more control on the Thai money\nmarket.\n    The Bank of Thailand is taking \"a step in the right\ndirection\" by planning to float three billion baht in bonds to\nmop up part of the surplus, he said, but he added the bank has\nbeen lax in using its bond repurchase window as a tool to\nabsorb or inject liquidity into the market.\n    William Wu, head of the Treasury Unit of Chase Manhattan\nBank N.A., Said the money market lacks the instruments to\nabsorb liquidity and avoid sharp interest rate fluctuations.\n    He said the liquidity has fuelled the stock market's\nstrongest rally in seven years and Thailand should seize the\nopportunity to develop the corporate bond market.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Major Japanese automakers are gearing up\nto equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that\ncould become standard on high-grade cars in the future,\nautomotive industry sources said.\n    Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they\nsaid. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel\nsteering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a\nmodel with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims\nto ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will\ndepend on initial consumer reaction.\n    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated\nfour-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.\nToyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field\nat a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will\nuse the system in the near future.\n    Though major U.S. And European automakers have also\nresearched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are\nwaiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for\nfurther improvements in safety and costs.\n    Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into\nparking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. \n    Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve\nsafety. \"At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more\ncontrol,\" said one official. \"On slippery surfaces or at high\nspeeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle.\"\n    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda\nengineer said: \"This invention is not intended to improve\nsafety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily.\"\n    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to\nturn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow\nspeeds but in the same direction at high speeds.\n    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the\ndirection of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the\nfront wheels. With Nissan's system the rear wheels move only\nparallel to the front.\n    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the\nfour-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.\n    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer said\nfour-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is\nuncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or\nprofits. \"All automakers are interested in something new,\" he\nsaid. \"If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to\nfollow.\"\n    The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick\nto sell cars. \"It's a benefit of a secondary nature compared\nwith devices for fuel economy or emission control.\"\n    General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering\nsystem, but is unlikely to market it within the next five\nyears, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of General\nMotors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to the\nconsumer, he added.\n    The industry sources said the additional cost of the system\nin Japan would probably make little difference to the consumer\nas it would be added to already high-priced models.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has\nbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year\nbeef accord next March 31.\n    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales\nfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports\nfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although\nthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.\n    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its\nbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain\nimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.\n    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when\nUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has\nthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.\nAgricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing\nsome one billion dlrs in new business.\n    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import\ncontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,\npurees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,\nprepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.\n    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's\ntop business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove\nresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.\n    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional\nreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue\nshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the\nindustrial sector.\n    \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these\nissues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official\nsaid.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought West\nGermany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.\n    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reduction\nin working hours to 38.5 from 40.\n    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key North\nWuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trend\nfor the rest of the country.\n    IG-Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,\nblamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. He\nsaid they had been uncompromising on the question of the\nshorter week.\n    Hans-Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said any\nplan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours was\nunacceptable. \n    The employers have not made an official offer on cutting\nthe working week, but sources involved in the negotiations say\nthat they are working on the basis of a possible half-hour\nreduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987\nand of 1.5 pct in 1988.\n    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officially\ndeclared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.\n    IG-Metall has said that cutting the working week will\ncreate jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people are\nunemployed.

The\nceiling for investment trust firms was fixed at 50 pct.\n    South Korean firms have traditionally preferred obtaining\nlow interest bank loans -- the current rate is 10 pct -- to\nissuing bonds at a higher rate or floating share issues with\nthe attendant dividend pressures and launch expenses.\n    The Seoul Stock Exchange, with 355 listed stocks, grew\nexplosively in the first three months of the year, building on\nan already impressive 68.9 pct gain in 1986.\n    Analysts now expect the market to pause temporarily and\nthen resume its upward movement, despite the indirect\ngovernment regulation.\n    They said the continuous growth of the nation's gross\nnational product (GNP) and trade surplus, improved exports and\ngood performances by industrial firms all fuelled the boom.\n    The trade surplus widened to 460 mln dlrs in March from 110\nmln in February, while government economists expect GNP to grow\nnine pct this year.\n    Analysts said the deep slump in the real estate market also\nincreased liquidity in the stock market.\n    \"Many investors are still confident the market will not lose\nits strength. It seems likely to pause for a while and then\nrebound again,\" said Park Sin-bom, a director of Lucky\nSecurities Co.\n    \"There are more positive factors than negative. The market\nis still buoyed by ample liquidity thanks to the economy's\nstrong performance.\"\n    The stock market began to recover during Saturday's\nhalf-day session with the index closing at 397.24 in active\ntrading on Monday, but closed lower on Tuesday at 390.24 on\nturnover of 76 billion won.\n    \"I would say the market is flat for the time being.... It is\nvery prone to profit-taking after the sharp gains in the first\nthree months and the various government measures,\" a foreign\nanalyst said.\n    \"But the market will head up again after a rest because the\nfundamentals are expected to rise and investors will be as\nbullish as ever at the slightest sign of a market recovery.\"\n    He added that the newly launched 30 mln dlr Korea Europe\nFund would have an impact on the South Korean stock market,\ndespite its small volume compared with the 5.72 trillion won of\nlisted capital on the Seoul exchange.\n    Local dealers recommend blue chips and financial shares as\nthese stand to benefit most from continuing trade friction\nbetween the United States and Japan and the rumoured\nrestructuring of local finance houses.\n    Dealers also cite the shares of domestically oriented\nfirms, which are less vulnerable to the effects of the gradual\nappreciation of the won.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

These were reforming the government's fiscal\nposition and stimulating domestic demand.\n    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, \"In looking at the\ncurrent situation of the economy and the relationship between\nJapan and the United States, we feel we have to place more\nemphasis on stimulating demand.\"\n    Economists predict battles within the government over the\ncoming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the\ncracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of\nfiscal discipline.\n    \"The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in\nthe dike, it will lead to a flood,\" Industrial Bank's Taketomi\nsaid.\n    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in\nplace to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely\nto give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.\n    \"This seems to mark the first step toward a more active\nfiscal policy in response to requests from the international\ncommunity,\" he said.\n    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements\nthe LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the\n1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,\nHis current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary\nbudget of around 1,000 billion yen.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Equally, there was the possibility\nthat the consortium would go ahead with the Superfan later on.\n    Rolls RB211 engine was not available for fitting to early\nversions of the Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747 but had since captured\nabout 25 pct of the market, he noted.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This could be achieved within\nseveral years, though not within one year.\n    He said liberalisation was possible because South Korea's\ncurrent account had turned from a deficit to a surplus, which\nhad brought in foreign funds and increased domestic savings.\n    The current account recorded a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs\nin 1986 after a deficit of 890 mln dlrs in 1985.\n    But Kim said the government needed to reorganise much of\nthe financial sector.\n    Kim said mergers of some financial companies and the\nupgrading of others to merchant banks or full banks were being\nconsidered by the financial development committee of the\nfinance ministry. He did not elaborate but said he expected no\ndrastic measures to be announced this year.\n    On liberalisation of the country's stock market, Kim said\ndespite Seoul's determination to open it up, free investments\nthere by foreigners would not be allowed in the near future\nbecause the market was currently \"over-heated.\" He said this was\ndue to ample liquidity created partly by the country's current\naccount surplus.\n    Kim said the market was extremely vulnerable to a sudden\ninflux of foreign funds because it was still very small in\nterms of size and numbers of shareholders.\n    \"Opening up the capital market must wait until the\nvulnerability to such an influx is removed,\" he said.\n    He said only about one mln South Koreans, out of a\npopulation of 40 mln, invest in the Seoul market.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Australian markets are booming as foreign\nfund managers redirect capital away from the United States and\nother traditional markets, analysts said.\n    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and\nan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of\nfresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and\nU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.\n    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in\nand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they\ndiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.\n    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in\nthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the\ncurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.\n    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital\nare not available, but brokers said they received almost daily\ninquiries from Japan and the United States.\n    \"These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about\nand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending\nup here with the attraction of high interest rates and\nreasonable currency stability,\" National Australia Bank Ltd\neconomist Brian Hamley said.\n    \"There is a 'flight to quality',\" Hamley said. \"Australia may\nnot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too\nmany other countries where you'd want to put your money.\"\n    The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting\ninvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against\nthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.\n    \"We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.\nWhere some people would be concerned about the value of the\nU.S. Dollar,\" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose\nsaid. \"Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap\nand the currency looks stable?\"\n    But turning that capital into more permanent productive\ninvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.\n    \"It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the\ndirection in the economy,\" Buttrose said, adding that offshore\ninvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tough\neconomic statement on May 14.\n    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding\ninterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as\neasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were\nbadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar\nand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.\n    \"It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be\ndelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one\nmight see a substantial outflow,\" Buttrose said.\n    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough\neconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and\nstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.\n    \"They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think\nthey would like to leave the money here,\" Buttrose said.\n    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased\ninterest in investment in Australia and the need to shield\nJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.\n    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an\nelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currency\npolicy when he said authorities could not take their \"eyes off\nthe yen\" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.\n    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked\nsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar\nwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.\n    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the\nAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a\ntrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.\n    Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming\nAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other\nmarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the\nweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into\nequities, particularly in the gold sector.\n    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3\ntoday, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while\nthe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the\nsame period.\n    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese\ncompanies that have invested heavily in the United States in\nrecent years turning their attention to undervalued real\nestate, particularly in the tourism field.\n    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star\nRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs\nas indicative of the type of property being sought.\n    \"They think they find good value real estate here which,\nwith long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of\ninvestment Australia needs,\" Buttrose added.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden\neconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\nwill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\nsay.\n    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\noil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\ndomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\nafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\nprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n    Factors depressing economic activity include the\n6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which\nthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the\nGulf and has sapped business confidence.\n    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\nwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\ncaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\nnew debt settlement program was introduced.\n    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\ntrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\nspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\nstill owed by individuals and companies.\n    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\nin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\none-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\nbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\nGulf.\n    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\nimportant.\"\n    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

His petition said UCPB's\nplans to sell the shares to SMC were \"a serious breach of\nfiduciary duties.\"\n    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be\nheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a\ngovernment nominee on the company's board.\n    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,\nasked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by\nthe company's board.\n    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the\nsequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per\nshare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained\nearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the\npurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of\ndividends.\n    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate\nan SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt\nto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon\ndel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would\nboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.\n    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier\nsuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres\nSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.\n    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming\nlast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong\nsubsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.\nThe loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board\nmeeting.\n    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to\nresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by\nApril 15.\n    \"The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of\na continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard\nof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early\ndisposition of the sequestered shares,\" San Miguel Corp said in\na statement.\n    \"Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have\nreached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of\npayment, this suit is in direct contravention of the\ngovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement\nof the controversy by April 15,\" the statement added.\n    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on\nCojuangco's court petition, adding: \"Any statement coming from\nus might be interpreted as adversarial.\"\n    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which\nsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible\nto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United\nStates citizen.\n    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln \"A\" shares,\nwhich can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln \"B\" shares which\nare available to foreign buyers.\n    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among\nprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by\nthe &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed\ninstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers\nin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.\n    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on\nGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were\nowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President\nFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the\nU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend\nannounced last June.\n    \"We have no objection to Soriano buying the \"B\" shares,\" Diaz\ntold Reuters. \"But everything is on hold now.\"\n    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy\nwould be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'\nmeeting, scheduled for May 14.\n    San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion\npesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in\n1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of\n700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Economic and Social\nCommission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said the\ninternational economic environment reversed the fortunes of the\ntrade-oriented economies of the six ASEAN member countries.\n    It said the already low 1985 growth rates of ASEAN's oil\nexporting countries -- Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia --\ndropped further after the oil price fall.\n    Three oil importers -- Singapore, the Philippines and\nThailand -- improved their performance mainly by restructuring\ntheir economies. But the report said the oil price fall reduced\nexport earnings, worsening economic prospects for the\nexporters.\n    The exporters' non-oil commodity prices did not show major\nimprovement and protectionist pressures from industrial\ncountries restricted export of manufactured products, it said.\n    The GDPs of Indonesia, which was 1.9 pct in 1985, and\nMalaysia, which fell a real one pct, barely grew in 1986.\n    The two countries, buffeted by unfavourable external\nfactors in the past few years, were forced to curb aggregate\ndomestic consumption demands last year to avoid severe balance\nof payments pressures and to resort to extensive commercial\nborrowings.\n    The U.N. Body said the economic outlooks of Singapore,\nThailand and the Philippines improved steadily in 1986 as the\nyear advanced. It said the most favourable factor benefiting\nthe three was the realignment of key currencies, especially the\nappreciation of the yen, which has resulted in the increased\ncompetitiveness of their exports against those from Japan.\n    The report said the downward spiral plaguing the Philippine\neconomy since 1983 was reversed into an estimated 0.9 pct GDP\ngrowth in 1986 with agriculture and public utilities becoming\ngrowth sectors.\n    It said the resumption of the Philippines' sustained growth\nrests largely on a satisfactory solution of its debt problem.\n    ESCAP said the yen appreciation, together with economic\nrestructuring measures, played a big role in helping Singapore\nrecover faster than expected from its 1.8 pct GDP decline in\n1985.\n    It said the Singapore GDP achieved a growth of over one pct\nlast year after registering positive growth from the second\nquarter.\n    The Singapore economic revival was hampered by its own\nadjustment measures especially its two-year wage freeze\nenforced last April, a glut of its property market and\ndepressed conditions in its ASEAN neighbours which hurt\nSingapore because they take about a quarter of its total\nexports.\n    The report said Thailand benefited from the changing world\neconomic environment far more than any of its ASEAN neighbours.\n    The Thai performance stemmed from the expansion o&#127; its\nnon-traditional export items last year to cover more\nmanufactured products and its greater exploration of\nunsaturated export markets such as Asia, the Middle East and\nthe European Community.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

There is no evidence rules were broken.\n    The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports that\nbanks had \"parked\" open currency positions for short periods with\nVW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currency\npositions that can be carried by banks overnight.\n    The press allegations emerged after VW said it may have\nlost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.\n    LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Their\ninspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office\nin West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany.\n    Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currency\nspeculation, West Germany limited a bank's total open positions\novernight to 30 pct of shareholders' equity and reserves.\n    German press reports have said some banks circumvented this\nrule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them.\n    The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreign\nexchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.\n    The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs that\nthe regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible\nto instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.\n    The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from\nbanks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely\ninspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.\n    But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors to\ndetect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies\nand therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.\n    \"If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, it\nwill be even harder for our inspectors,\" said one official.\n    It would be up to the public prosecutors to order special\nchecks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they\nsaid. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VW\ncurrency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VW's former\nchief foreign exchange dealer.\n    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by\na 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme\ncases by removal of the managers if their active involvement is\nproved.\n REUTER\n&#3;",
