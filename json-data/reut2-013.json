The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for\nJapan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside\ncompetition.\n    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of\nattempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said \"I am not sure\nit is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of\nMrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a\npersonal interest in this problem.\n    \"I don't understand it to be closed at all.\"\n    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be\n\"talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what\nthey do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very\nserious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not\nas free as we allow access to our markets to be.\"\n    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain\ncould revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance\ninstitutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar\ntreatment in financial markets in Japan soon.\n    \"I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,\"\nHoward added.\n    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo\nStock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,\nand Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.\n    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any\nsignificant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese\ntelecommunications industry.\n    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined\nagain today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.\nThis was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul\nChannon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.\n    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain\nbelieved a \"sensible solution\" could be found which would open\nJapanese markets to British goods.\n    Government officials were at pains today to deny that\nBritain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise\nsimilar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial\nfirms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.\n    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials\nhad said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial\ninstitutions could be imposed from then but that this did not\nnecessarily constitute a deadline.\n    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against\nJapanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But\ndespite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade\nelsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to\nbackfire.\n    He said in a radio interview today  \"it is true that we\nbenefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose\nthose advantages. And I am sure they are making their views\nplain to the Japanese government on this matter.\"\n    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before\nreturning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was\nplanned well before the current trade row.\n    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also\ninclude ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global\nmarkets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a\ncooperation between national regulatory bodies.\n    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging\ninformation to combat financial fraud would be sought with\nJapan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between\nBritain and the United States.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He\nis an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched\nthe U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October,\n1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by\nthe World Bank.\n    Conable also said that he expected the result of a major\nstudy of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next\nseveral weeks.\n    He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in\npart, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the\npoorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the\nrichest countries because of inefficiency.\n    the reorganization is considered a major initiative by\nConable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151\nmember-countries as an indication of his management style and\npriorities.\n    \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who\nmust support it as soundly constituted so that it will be\npermitted to grow,\" Conable said.\n    However, he said \"I don't believe there is anything\nbasically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it\nhas to have any redefinition of its purpose.\"\n    He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt\ninitiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role\nin dealing with the debt crisis.\n    Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its\nsister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and\nthat he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel\nCamdessus on a variety of issues.\n    On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need\nto put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don't have\na particular mission here except to be useful to the\ninstitution and to the process of development.\"\n    He added, \"so I don't feel a great calling to personalize\nthe institution.\"\n    On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said\nthat the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting\nthe region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing\nof 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development\nAssociation was earmarked for Africa.\n    Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new\nforms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those\nin the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "A steep drop in goods-producing jobs\ndetracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes\nit unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary\npolicy to defend the dollar, economists said.\n    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less\nthan the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets\nexpected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with\nFebruary's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment\ndropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.\n    \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we\nend the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley\nand Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in\nthe second and third quarters.\"\n    \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\"\nhe said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but\nclearly they can't tighten.\"\n    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward\nrevision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000\nfrom 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter\nwere weaker than expected.\n    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.\ngross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March\njobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter\ngrowth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.\n    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average\nmonthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only\n237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.\n    \"There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, \nbut less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs\nwere subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed\ntightening for exchange-related purposes.\"\n    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January\nlevel of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing\nhours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9\nhours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.\n    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing\njobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and \nelectronic manufacturing.\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a\n13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for\nnearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.\n    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories\nresulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with\nthe labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.\n    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five\npct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in\nthe first-quarter GNP accounts.\n    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two\npct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the\nsecond and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial\nactivity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate\ncontribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"\n    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains\nin industrial production and personal income for March.\nThey expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for\nthese indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct\nin industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.\n    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop\nin March construction employment may also signal a drop in\nMarch housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851\nmillion units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in\nJanuary.\n    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level\nsince March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed\nout that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which \nfell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.\n    \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for\nwork, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much,\" he said.\n    He said the latest employment report will not concern the\nFed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of\n2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can't afford to tighten\nto quickly either.\"\n    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal\nfluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor\nforce gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them\nin January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with\nhis forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.\n    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think\nthat the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their\nmeeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to\nease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March\nemployment report \"increases the likelihood they won't tighten,\nregardless of the dollar.\"\n\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Lawrence said. \"Their (Fox) saving\ngrace is that their parent has deep pockets.\"\n    The question television industry, advertising and Wall\nStreet executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure\nadvertisers from the big three: CBS Inc &lt;CBS>, ABC, and NBC, a\nunit of General Electric Co &lt;GE>.\n    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in\n1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting for\nall of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analysts\nnoted.\n    \"They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the\ntraditional networks,\" said Jon Mandel, associate media\ndirector at Grey Advertising Inc.\n    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainment\nattorney said, \"If they have enough money, they have a good\nchance of making it work.\"\n    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to\nlose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln\ndlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a\nprofit.\n    To succeed, the company must also win over the young\nviewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two of\nwhich debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.\n    The first Fox-produced program -- \"The Late Show,\"\nfeaturing comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on\nFox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the\nshow has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captive\nyoung audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.\n    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,\n\"Married ... with Children,\" which Kellner describes as an\nalternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.\nIt is also airing \"The Tracy Ullman Show,\" featuring the\nBritish comedienne, singer and actress.\n    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the\nU.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated\nstations.\n    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, the\ncompany is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three\ntimes in the course of the evening.\n    \"I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional\nnetworks, it would be extremely high-rated,\" Mandel said, who\nadded that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in\nadvertising for the shows.\n    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth\nnetwork. Robert Adler, president of the Cabletelevision\nAdvertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to the\naudience Fox is attempting to win. \"There are already many\nalternatives out there to the three networks,\" he said.\n    And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Fox\nthe competition. An ABC spokesman said, \"the schedule we've put\ntogether for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox's\nprogramming schedule into account.\"\n    But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping a\neye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and with\nits advertisers.\n    Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Asked\nwhether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday's\ndebut, Kellner said, \"the last thing I want to do is worry\nabout ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told me\nto do.\"\n\n Reuter\n&#3;",

High cholesterol levels in\nthe blood are a risk factor for heart disease.\"\n    Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.\nAgriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,\nsaid the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with\nhigh saturated fat levels was highest among those who have\nheart disease.\n    The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid\ncontent of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than\n20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.\n    David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said\nU.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273\nmln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers\nwere aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.\n    Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.\nsoybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.\n    U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln\nlbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year\nearlier, according to Commerce Department figures.\n    Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3\nmln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Maciej said he sees crude\noil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC\nproduction accord will continue to support prices.\n    However, several companies share the optimistic industry\noutlook expressed by a majority of analysts.\n    Shell Canada and &lt;Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast\nimproved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this\nweek, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.\n    \"The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not\nrobust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.\n    \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is\ngood reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,\ncontinued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added.\n    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have\npared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,\ndeferring most frontier exploration work.\n    \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments,\nvery conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\"\nCanadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.\n    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion\nthe industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.\n    The most significant help came last September when the\nfederal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax\n(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.\n    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil\ncompanies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.\n    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow\ndecline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further\nexploration spending cuts, analysts said.\n    \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely\nnecessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that\nwere made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably\nmore,\" Maciej said.\n Reuter\n\n\n&#3;",

        "body": "The Federal Open Market Committee at\nits February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the\nthen-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.\n    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy\ndirective which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than\neasier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January\nthrough March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no\nM-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a\nseven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.\n    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds\nrate \"reference\" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.\n    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members\ndiscussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in\nParis for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No\nconclusions were contained in the minutes.\n    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC\nsaid that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or\nslightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable\ndepending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into\naccount the strength of the business expansion, developments in\nforeign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and\nconditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"\n    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged\npolicy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president\nfavored some tightening of reserve conditions.\n    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November\nthrough January and the firm federal funds rate that had\nprevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He\nalso cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.\n    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential\nfor a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed\nthat prompt restraints might avert the need for more\nsubstantial tightening later.\n    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC\nminutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy\nimplementation should be especially alert to the potential need\nfor some firming of reserve conditions.\"\n    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve\nrestraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in\nline with current expectations and there were concurrent\nindications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the\nbackground of stronger economic data.\n    One indication of potential price pressure might be a\nfurther tendency for the dollar to weaken.\n    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,\npreferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing\nduring the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not\nwant to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during\nthe inter-meeting period, although they did not view the\nconditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"\n    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the\ndollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any\nsignificant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In\naddition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be\nmade in reducing the federal budget deficit.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply\nhigher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market\nCommittee voted in February to maintain the then-existing\ndegree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.\n    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and\na minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that\npushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal\nfunds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.\n    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4\nhigher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from\n7.93 pct yesterday.\n    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that\nrecent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a\nanother factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.\n    \"Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which\nshould give them more room to not tighten,\" she said. \"Both M2\nand M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in\nMarch.\"\n    \"The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,\"\nZielonka said. \"Dollar considerations will prevent them from\neasing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy\nweak and the banks having to deal with Brazil.\"\n    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only\nby a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm\npayrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to\n236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.\n    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by\nfears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when\nthe dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its\ngains.\n    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,\nbut a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying\nlate in the day that offset this somewhat.\n    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from\nthis week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and\nJapan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors\nfrom buying U.S. Treasury bonds.\n    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32\nin Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped\nthe U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen\nyesterday.\n    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills\nrose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis\npoints and the year bill fell two basis points.\n    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills\nresulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a\ncustomer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by\nforeign central banks to support the dollar.\n    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a\ndecline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the\nsession, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.\n    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct\nbid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to\nrespective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This lends some encouragement to the\nidea that we're looking at a pretty strong year,\" he said.\n    In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on\nan annual basis, before dropping again.\n    Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to\ntake advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from\nnormal January selling.\n    But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market\nand a growing array of incentives have lured customers to\ndealers' showrooms, analysts said.\n   Ford Motor Co &lt;F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to\n79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's\nsecond largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to\n197,328 compared to 167,490.\n    Chrysler Corp &lt;C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454\ncompared with 33,669.

But\nsales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from\n370,390.\n    Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the\nslackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales\ndecline in memory.\n    \"Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a\nphenomenon unheard of two years ago,\" said Scott Merlis at\nMorgan Stanley. \"Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so\nthey've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general.\"\n    General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2\npct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year\nand far below the 56 pct of most of last year.\n    Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the\nfirst three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise\nfrom 13.7 pct since the start of the year.\n    Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted\nthe company to decide this week to close six plants for a week\nto bring supply into line with demand.\n    But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further\nproduction cuts might be necessary.\n    \"While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter\nproduction already because of weak sales, the continuation of\nthis weakening market share suggests another production cutback\nis likely,\" Glantz said.\n    Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during\nthe March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp &lt;AMC> 1,198,\ndown 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda\n16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It has generally\nbeen current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on\npayments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development\nBank.\n    But tonight Garcia said: \"We have met our aim of limiting\nthe payment of the debt and will limit it also even though\norganisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us\nto buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types\nof public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars\nthan that which they are willing to newly lend us.\"\n    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank\nabout 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr\ndebt.\n    Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin\nAmerica because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line\non debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.\n    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage\nto 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage\nworkers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.\n    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants\nand 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but\nnot covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n    He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1,\n1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per\nU.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the\nyear. He did not say when this increase would be effective.\n    Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue\nearner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes.\nSales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up,\nhe said, without specifying the amount.\n    Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians\nto repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct\npremium above the market exchange rate.\n    The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is\n14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.\n    To encourage private investment, he said the government\nwould set up a special fund with which it would match every two\nintis of private investment with one inti from the government.\n    He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander\nLieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday\nstrengthened the democratic authority of his government.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Under an international convention, the\ndraft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinent\nauthorities.\n    Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash, a\nMinistry spokesman declined comment.\n    On September 6, 1985, Boeing issued an official statement\nsaying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan Air\nLines plane in 1978 were faulty.\n    However, no official, direct connection was then made\nbetween the faulty repairs and the crash.\n    The Japanese investigation team says in its draft report\nthat it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the\n1985 accident, the investigator said.\n    The Boeing statement after the crash said: \"Examination of\nthe wreckage, the flight data recorder readout, the cockpit\nvoice recorder, and interviews with the surviving off-duty\nflight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flight\ndue to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead.\n    \"The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of the\ncrash has revealed that a relatively small section of the\nbulkhead splice, approximately 17 per cent, was not correctly\nassembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landing\naccident,\" the statement said.\n    The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident at\nOsaka airport, in western Japan, in which the plane's tail\nscraped the runway.\n    The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectors\nwho in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving the\nrepairs, he said.\n    Police had investigated four inspectors, including one man\nwho two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide after\nfour days of police questioning.\n    \"None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work,\" the\ninvestigator said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Growth in oil consumption in the Western\nindustrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct\nthis year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International\nEnergy Agency (IEA) said.\n    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around\none pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in\nits Monthly Oil Market Report.\n    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from\ntransport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are\nhigher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be\nbelow last year's 3.6 pct, it said.\n    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices\nstay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can\nbe expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some\nof the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there\nmay be slightly less growth in transport fuels.\n    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at\n428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.\nThis is about the same level as at the begining of the year.\n    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the\nprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of\nthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.\n    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell\nby 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the\nyear. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but\na decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.\n    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,\nparticulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,\nthere is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported\nstocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.\n    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes\non April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built\nup strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the\nperiod.\n    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is\ncontinuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more\nor less in line with consumption, after declining for five\nyears, the IEA noted.\n    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6\nmln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January\n1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,\nrespectively.\n    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April\n1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to\n94 days of consumption.\n    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln\nbpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.\n    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude\nproduction to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5\nmln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from\ncentrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.\n    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first\nquarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd\nof crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average\nfor the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled\n28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.\n    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast\n3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the\nlargest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA\nsaid.\n    Saudi Arabia\"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain\ncautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias\nas market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the\neconomy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.\n    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,\nthat the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will\nkeep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.\n    Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to\nestablish and hold a new trading range at higher interest\nrates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\n    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy\nsaid that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy\ninvestment climate, the market will have no confidence in this\nenvironment until there is illumination of and confidence in\nU.S. Dollar/trade policy.\n    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,\nhighly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if\ncurrency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas\neconomic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.\n    \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these\ndevelopments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said.\n    \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager\nconfidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while\nlonger,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving\nSecurities Corp.\n    However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term\nperspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying\nopportunity.\"\n    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on\nunexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury\nbonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and\nThursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.\n    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long\nbond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.\nBonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.\n    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a\nsimilar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar\nclosing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,\nhowever, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the\nyield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.\n    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said\nthat many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach\nnine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.\n    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have\nspoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and\nthey continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to\npersist over the next few months.\n    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers\nlast week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate\nrise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by\nmidyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.\n    \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the\nrise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen\nsince the start of the year,\" Held said.\n    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.\n    \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said\neconomists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\n    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up\ninterest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar\nand head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm\nthe fragile U.S. Economic expansion.\n    The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy\nstance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm\ndomestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of\ncausing a further decline in the dollar.\"\n    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)\nmeeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy\nunchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy\nlater if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit\nmarkets warranted a policy shift.\n    However, economists generally believe that continued fairly\nsluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.\nBanks resulting from their problem loans to developing\ncountries rule out any Fed policy firming.\n    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at\nlast Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.\n    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little\nimpact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on\nWednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.\n    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.\nPurchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic\nindicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A\nFriday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first\nquarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP\ngrowth of about three pct if continued through 1987.\n    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are\nexpected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But if average\nconsumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for\nthese fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.\n    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar\ncurrent levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.\n    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of\nthe market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.\n    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD\narea at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This\nis about the same as at the begining of the year.\n    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the\nprojected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of\nthe year which offset a reduction in stocks.\n    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes\non April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender\n1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to\n102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.\n    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is\ncontinuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line\nwith consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.\n    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put\nat 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one\nand equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.\n    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down\nfrom the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to\n94 days of consumption.\n    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company\nstocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first\nquarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of\n400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in\nMarch.\n    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,\nparticulary for March, it said.\n    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also\nbeen a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the\nIEA said.\n    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about\ntwo bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.\n    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude\nproduction to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd\nin January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally\nPlanned Economies, the IEA said.\n    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first\nquarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months\nof 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as\nagainst 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.\n    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast\n3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest\nfactor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The previous\nrecord for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.\n    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming\nmeasures should include the issue of construction bonds and the\nuse of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon\nTelegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.\n    An LDP statement said the government should use the\nadditional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and\nto revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Another\nforecast a 92 seat Conservative majority in a new parliament.\n    One dealer reported a large sterling buying order from a\nJapanese institution earlier today.\n    But dealers were cautious to push sterling much higher amid\nwariness of intervention by the Bank of England.

Shell declined 5p to 1,228.\n    Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines.\nBarclays eased a penny to 503, as did Natwest at 588.\n    Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid\nspeculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert\nHolmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday.\nDealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer\nfor Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds\nrose one penny to 488.\n    Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point, mostly\ndue to bullish sentiment generated by today's opinion polls,\ndealers said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the\nICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special\nDrawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.\n    Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last\nmonth by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer\nstock manager has completed preparations, traders said.\n    Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer\nstock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used\nto calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average\nabove the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.\n    The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of\nthe second, third and fourth positions on the London and New\nYork futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per\ntonne yesterday.\n    Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and\nSeptember, but these are set to change to July, September and\nDecember on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot\nmonth, traders noted.\n    The introduction of December into the calculations may lift\nthe daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75\nstg above May on the London terminal market.\n    But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the\nhigher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the\nindicator which governs his activities, traders said.\n    \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the\nimplications of delaying until forward prices lift the\nindicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an\nanalyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.\n    Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000\ntonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach\nthis level within six months, buying is suspended pending an\nICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market\nwatchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent\nforecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln\nto two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to\nthree mln.\n    A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87\nworld surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared\nwith a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of\n94,000 tonnes, traders said.\n    In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to\nbuy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the\n\"must buy\" level.\n    But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put\nconstraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock\nmanager can remove cocoa from the market.\n    The buffer stock system of price differentials set\naccording to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from\nnon-members could limit the buffer stock's scope for action,\ndealers said.\n    Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is\nnearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.\n    But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as\nMalaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa\ncan only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer\nstock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.\n    Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member\ncocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are\npressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.\n    Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from\nquality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact\non futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for\nthis cocoa over futures.\n    Ghana's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg\nfrom 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer\nstock buying, dealers said.\n    \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will\nprovide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.\n    Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer\nstock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to\npredict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically\nbuffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer\nstock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the\nprevious cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers\nexpressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.\n    In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding\nscheme as an additional market support mechanism.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

And if the market starts regarding anything that\ncomes out negatively then it means that the underlying\nsentiment is negative,\" he said.\n    Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's\nundertone.\n    Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan\nto support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by\ninstitutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.\n    After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent\nweeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,\ninterest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.\n    \"We can start to look at a point in time where the interest\nshifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the\nother European currencies,\" the U.S. Bank dealer said.\n    Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of\ntaking significant new positions during the Washington\nmeetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,\nBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German\nAffairs group on international monetary issues later.\n    The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set\na new securities repurchase tender to add money market\nliquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the\nlast several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it\nmight cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,\nsignalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.\n    Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said\nthe Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A\nmonetary policy which took into account exchange rates and\ncapital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate\noriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.\n    Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from\n2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention,\nbrought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480.\n    The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from\n120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after\n30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per\n100.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

A\nwave of professional sales hit the market at 1000 GMT, driving\nthe price to a low of 124 after minor support at 124-6/32 was\nbreached.\n    This coincided with a dip in sterling to 72.2 on its trade-\nweighted index against 72.3 at the start and 72.4 last night.\n    At the same time, the dollar was dipping below 145 yen\nafter a night of pressure in the Far East.\n    June T-bond futures made lows of 97-18/32 and settled\naround 97-21/32 at 1015 GMT after opening 8/32 easier at\n97-26/32.\n    Analysts said the markets remained cautious because of a\nseries of talks in Washington this week between finance\nministers of industrial countries.\n    June Eurodollars started at 93.33, a technical support\npoint, and eased to 93.30 or 0.06 below last night.\n    Analysts said sterling contracts would have difficulty\nadvancing beyond current levels if the market discounts the\nConservative victory predicted by the opinion polls.\n    Other difficulties were sterling's inability to breach the\n2.96 mark ceiling, which could indicate the Bank of England is\ntrying hard to keep a lid on the U.K. Currency.\n    Also, market talk of a further base rate cut has died down,\nalthough another cut was virtually discounted by mid-March.\n    June short sterling futures were little changed in early\ntrading from last night's 90.78 but slipped to a low of 90.73\nby late morning. Interbank interest rates were unchanged.\n    June FT-SE 100 futures saw an opening range of 204 to\n203.70 in line with last night's 203.80 but made a low of\n202.20 late morning.

The pound fetched 2.9480/9520 marks and\n1.6190/6200 dlrs at midsession after its opening 2.9540/75 and\n1.6213/23, and yesterday's closing 2.9490/9530 and 1.6163/73.\n    Dealers said dollar business had virtually halted in Europe\nafter a large selloff against the yen in the Far East, which\nsustained Bank of Japan intervention failed to stem earlier\ntoday.\n    They said that in the absence of other factors,\nparticipants awaited the outcome of the informal talks of Group\nof Five finance ministers and central bankers in Washington\ntoday, and Group of Seven monetary talks tomorrow.\n    Most dealers expected the meetings to produce little more\nthan a vaguely worded statement to reaffirm shared objectives\nof stable currency markets and economic policy coordination.\n    The Group of Five and Canada agreed in Paris on February 22\nto call a halt to the dollar's sharp decline, and several\nparticipant central banks have since intervened to keep\ncurrencies within narrow ranges against each other.\n    But a flare-up of the long-standing trade frictions between\nthe U.S. And Japan last month encouraged markets to test the\nagreement, pushing the dollar sharply lower against the yen.\n    Dealers said that short of a convincing undertaking by\nJapan at the Washington talks to step up efforts to reduce\ntrade surpluses and stimulate domestic demand, the dollar would\nresume its fall, especially against the yen.\n    Without agreement on the trade issue, the dollar appears\nset to test support levels at 143 yen in the very short term,\nwith 140 yen within reach over the next few weeks, dealers\nsaid.\n    Some dealers said Japan appears ready to compromise with\nthe U.S. On economic policy issues.\n    Expectations were rising of a further half-point cut in the\nJapanese discount rate and Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic\nParty today announced an outline agreement on economic\nreflation which includes a 5,000 billion yen additional budget\nfor 1987, the dealers said.\n    Some dealers said the market could get some impetus from\nU.S. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker when he testifies on\nThird World debt problems before the Senate banking committee\nlater today.\n    Dealers said sterling remained firm amid growing confidence\nthe ruling Conservative party is assured of victory in an\nelection which they said would likely be called for June.\n    One poll out today showed the Conservatives leading with 43\npct support against Labour's 30 pct and the Liberal-Social\nDemocratic Alliance at 26 pct. Another poll forecast a\nConserative majority of 92 seats in a new parliament.\n    But wariness of Bank of England sterling-selling\nintervention made participants cautious about pushing the pound\nmuch higher, dealers said.\n    Some dealers said the Bank of England was believed to have\nintervened on a small scale yesterday but others said they had\nnot detected such action. No polled dealer said he had sighted\nBank intervention today.\n    The dollar was quoted at 1.5110/20 Swiss francs at\nmidsession against 1.5130/40 at the opening and a 1.5180/90\nEuropean close. It fetched 6.0575/0625 French francs against\n6.0525/75 at the opening and 6.0660/0710 at close.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Those\nreturning within that period will have to prove to customs that\nthey have been on more than a shopping trip.\n    The tax move follows an official report showing that total\nborder imports, about three billion crowns in 1985, rose by\nsome 600 mln crowns in 1986, a trend which has alarmed Danish\nbusinesses, particularly in Jutland areas bordering Germany.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Foreign banks in West Germany are\nreassessing their positions after a number of changes in the\nmarkets and the regulatory environment that have dampened a\nonce-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here.\n    Banking sources said the most important changes were plans\nto bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios, the\nfirst such move in a major financial centre. This could place a\nserious burden on several foreign banks, particularly those\nactive in primary and secondary bond markets. Foreign banks had\nmuch lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks.\n    Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank\nand the banking supervisory office over bringing securities --\nprimarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios\nwere in progress.\n    Although no date had been set for imposition, banks as\nearly as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985\nrules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity\nand reserves.\n    Although other national regulatory authorities are known to\nbe considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation\nof debt previously in the balance sheet, Germany, with its\ntradition of prudence, may be the first.\n    Brian Kissack, president of the Foreign Banks Association,\ntold Reuters, \"It's not a positive sign. It could cause certain\npeople who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as\nattractive to get in now.\"\n    Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on\nholdings in mark securities to other centres which had less\nstringent ratios, taking business out of the country, he added.\n    But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other\npractical problems as well. These included,\n    -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to\nmake an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax.\n    -- signs that London's \"Big Bang\" may have deeper\nimplications for German securities trading than first thought.\n    -- difficulty in finding experienced securities\nprofessionals to staff new subsidiaries.\n    -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is\nforcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities.\n    -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market\nshare by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks.\n    By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the\ninitial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition\ngovernment, Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished.\n    The tax is 0.25 pct on each side of a securities trade by a\nnon-bank, but it is not levied on public authority bonds.\n    This extra cost, particularly for finely-priced instruments\nsuch as floating rate notes, had kept much mark securities\nbusiness firmly in the City, awaiting a change. But aside from\nthis, London was more active than domestic houses had expected.\n    Large U.S., British, Japanese and Swiss investors often\npreferred to execute block trades -- 50,000 shares and up --\nwith City market makers who could absorb at least some of the\npaper in their own positions, diminishing the immediate impact\non the share price.\n    Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the\nexchange floor, cutting profits or adding to costs.\n    Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member\nMichael Zapf said London's share of German securities business\ndone was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh\nwhether establishment costs involved were worth the returns.\n    Additional signs that London market makers may move into\nsecondary level stocks had added to this concern, he said.\n    Now, plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark\nsecurities trading entirely to newly established, mainly\nFrankfurt-based units were being reassessed, sources said.\n    The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also\neffectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper\nmarket in certificates of deposit or commercial paper.\n    Many U.S. Investment and money centre banks in particular\nwere hoping experience in these would provide the lever to\nprise open tight credit relationships between companies and\ntheir domestic \"house\" banks.\n    At the moment, U.S. Investment banks are expanding fastest\nhere. A unit of Salomon Inc &lt;SB.N> began last summer and Morgan\nStanley Group Inc &lt;MS.N> is currently fitting out offices,\nprobably for a summer start to business.\n    A unit of &lt;Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin\noperations toward year end. Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER.N>\nand Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing\nconversion of current, small operations to full-standing units.\n    But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced\npersonnel in a hitherto fairly small market. The big three\nSwiss banks, which arrived between late 1985 and first half\n1986, have been steadily building up securities departments,\ntaking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors.\n    The two U.S. Banks longest established here, Citibank AG\nand Chase Bank AG, had been particularly hard hit.\n    Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial\nactivities and shut down German branch offices on orders from\nhead office. In the competitive environment, return on assets\nemployed was insufficient to meet requirements, sources said.\n    But the weakening attraction of \"Financial Centre Germany\"\nwas unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full\nsubsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark\neurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987.\n    Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd &lt;DIKB.T> and\nSumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> move in, competition for business,\nfor staff and even for premises would soar, sources said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The previous\nrecord for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.\n    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming\nmeasures should include the issue of construction bonds and the\nuse of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon\nTelegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.\n    An LDP statement said the government should use the\nadditional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and\nto revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Gainers led losers by seven-six\non the Big Board, while volume slid slightly to 175 mln shares\nfrom 213 mln shares last Friday.\n    \"I think we'll get a day that will be, on balance,\npositive, but not any record setter,\" Thom Brown of Butcher and\nSinger said.\n    Brown said that the market needs a pause before any\nstronger advance. \"We need a bit of consolidation here,\" he\nsaid. \"Eighty-five points is just too much, too soon.\"\n    Brown added that the market probably will not pay much\nattention to the February consumer credit number being released\ntoday. \"The market's been ignoring fundamentals,\" he said.\n    \"I don't see any problems with the Blue Chips easing higher\ntoday,\" Chris Callies of Dean Witter said.

        "body": "Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil\nproduction is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower\nyields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.\n    The publication expects total Malaysian output during\nJan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For\nEast Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000\ntonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75\nmln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.\n    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both\ncountries, but the effects of this will not be felt until\n1988-90.\n    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees\nreacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male\ninflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.\n    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected\nthis year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could\nespecially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,\nwhile in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and\nJuly/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.\n    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's\nyields and bigger effects are expected within the next three\nyears, Oil World said without elaborating.\n    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year\nwere put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in\nJanuary 1986, Oil World said.\n    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop\n500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East\nMalaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.\n    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about\neight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall\nIndonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct\nto 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,\nare put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.\n    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are\nboth running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the\ncountry's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during\nJan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of\nthe April elections and the religious Ramadan festival\nthroughout May, it said.\n    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to\n350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent\nIndonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the\ncountry but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill\nIndonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The high inflation rate is especially\ndamaging in view of Spain's trade balance with Europe, which\nturned into a deficit last year after entry to the EC.\n    Officials say the situation is rapidly deteriorating. The\ndeficit of 450 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 was\nonly slightly below the 515 mln dlr deficit for all of 1986.\n    The government has tightened up money supply, called for\nmaximum 5.0 pct wage increases -- the same as this year's\ninflation target -- and is pursuing a program of industrial\nrestructuring despite an unemployment rate of 21.5 pct.\n    Bankers say tight-money policies have attracted an\navalanche of foreign capital that is cashing in on the strong\npeseta and high interest rates and those funds, converted into\npesetas, are swelling money supply still further.\n    Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said last week that\nmoney supply is expected to rise 14.3 pct in the first quarter\ncompared with this year's eight pct target.\n    Most analysts agree that the government will have to accept\ninflation closer to six pct this year but they say there is\nlittle cause for alarm.\n    \"The money supply should be back on track by the summer and\nwe will begin to see lower interest rates,\" said Andres\nTrujillo, general manager of Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking\nCorp's Madrid branch.\n    He told Reuters the labour protests, despite occasional\noutbursts of violence, are not having a serious impact on\nforeign investment.\n    \"Spain is a big and relatively underdeveloped market,\" he\nsaid. \"It is still easier to compete from here than in other\ncountries and this sporadic unrest is not likely to scare off\ninvestors.\"\n    Juan Jose Macaya, general manager of Investban SA, a\nportfolio management company, said he expects monetary\nobjectives to be under control in two or three months.\n    \"There has been some nervousness in the stock exchange but\nwe see this as a short-term reaction,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The loan is for 10 years,\nwith four years grace. Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the\ngrace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct,\nCabrera said. There is also a front end fee of one pct.\n    The cost of the project totals 301.6 mln dlrs, of which ISA\nwill contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln, he added.\n    Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging\nthe commercial bank portion of the financing. Cabrera noted\nthat only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year.\n    He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to\nthe market no earlier than June. It is part of an overall\nfinancing for various projects in the electrical sector that\nwill take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year.\n    Of the total cost, he expects the World Bank and the IADB\nto contribute about 700 mln dlrs, with the Export-Import Bank\nof Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln. The balance will come\nfrom commercial banks.\n    Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in\nthe international capital markets this year.\n    The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in\nfloating rate notes, but the market has virtually disappeared\nin the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the\nnumber of market makers contracted sharply.\n    Cabrera said he is now considering several options,\nincluding a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan. Last\nyear Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for the\nequivalent of about 40 mln dlrs. Although it prefers a public\nissue, Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately.\n    Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday,\nwhich was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8\npct over Libor, was basically a \"disguised loan.\"\n    Cabrera said that as of December 31, 1986, Colombia had 11\nbillion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 3.4 billion dlrs\nof private sector debt.\n    Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billion\ndlrs, he said that about 1.4 billion had been arranged before\nthe end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will be\ndrawn in future years.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Last year the company\nearned 70 cts a share.\n    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.\n    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's\npresident Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of\n1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 \"are expected to cause\neven the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low.\"\n    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of\nthis year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of\n90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that\nCardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved\nfor the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.\n    Crossen said \"because Marion is still just a small company,\nthe growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom\nline.\" He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a\nshare from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.\n    \"The company has a broad new product pipeline in the\nindustry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most\ninnovative company in the business,\" he said.\n    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to\nhave a growth rate of 55 pct.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The round, which covers\n13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and\nservices will take four years to negotiate.\n    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial\ninstitutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World\nBank.

The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade\nrules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese\nchips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute\npanel be set up to review the agreement.\n    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade\nround to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose\ntariffs against Japanese electronic goods.\n    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets\nto U.S. Exports.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The Bundesbank could now\nassume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency\ninflows slow down.\n    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and\nlong term interest rate differentials, also encouraged\ninvestors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller\nsaid.\n    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary\ngrowth back onto the desired path, he said.\n    \"Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this\nquiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the\nchanged economic situation of the last few months,\" he added.\n    \"All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money\nsupply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite\nsuppositions to the contrary,\" Mueller said.\n    \"Keeping money supply developments in check is not always\nsynonymous with raising interest rates, especially when\nexcessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than\ngrowth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary\nholdings of non-banks,\" Mueller said.\n    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits\nother concepts were needed for monetary policy.\n    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for\nmonetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.\n    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.\nCurrency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.\n    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of\na strict stability policy because both interest rates and\nliquidity would be affected by required currency intervention\nand could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.\n    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the\nBundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other\nmarket conditions, Mueller said.\n    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central\nbank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.\n    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity\nof industry and households which cannot be directly reached\nwith the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.\n    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the\nharder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been\nthe case recently, because non-banks have received considerable\nsums from current account surpluses and capital imports.\n    \"If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise\nwith higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if\ncredit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed\nits target but probably even set off further inflows,\" he said.\n    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.\n    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate\nof seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.\n    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to\nsix pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock\ngrowth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.\n    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there\nshould be no change in priorities. \"Monetary policy must be\nfirst and foremost stability policy and successful stability\npolicy is money supply policy -- nothing else,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But it is\nlikely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus\nIndustrie> A340 aircraft.\n    The company's so-called \"pathfinder prospectus\" gives all the\ndetails of its stock market flotation except for the price at\nwhich shares will be offered.\n    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose\nin 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.\n    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit\nfor 1987.\n    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits\nand a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls\noperated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.\n    Assuming the company was valued at around eight times\nearnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about\n1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the\naerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.\n    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between\n1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.\n    The price will be increased by it being likely to have much\nof its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the\ncompany's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was\nrescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.\n    When the government announced the sale, it said it would\ninject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250\nmln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.\n    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit\nrating to match those of its main competitors such as General\nElectric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt\nand Whitney unit.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

At 1430\nGMT the FTSE 100 index was down 8.1 points at 1,981.5 compared\nwith an opening 1,987.4.\n    Concern over the possibility of a trade war with Japan,\nalthough less pronounced, provided further caution.\n    Yesterday, the Japanese finance ministry made moves to try\nand dispel fears of a trade war by saying it will help to\nexpand the Tokyo Stock Exchange membership to facilitate\nforeign membership.\n    However, British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard\nhas told Japan to resolve the row over Cable and Wireless'\nshareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or\nface an abrupt deterioration in trade relations.\n    Cable and Wireless, which has been at the centre of the\ntrade row, was up 2p at 372.\n    The latest media opinion polls helped to underpin prices as\nthey strengthened the belief that the ruling Tory party will\nwin the next U.K. General election. Although there is still\nuncertainty over the timing of the election, most dealers\npolled by Reuters this afternoon thought that June would be the\nmost likely time.\n    A poll conducted for the breakfast television programme\nTV-AM showed the Conservatives 13 points ahead of the\nOpposition Labour Party, while a poll in the Times newspaper,\nwhich measured party support in 73 key marginal seats, gave the\nTories a lead of six points over the labour opposition.\n    Market leader ICI stood unchanged at 1,335 but IC Gas\nslipped 14p to 752 on profit-taking after yesterday's stong\ngain while Jaguar rose 15p to 590 mainly on U.S demand ahead of\na motor show in New York.\n    Pharmaceuticals had Wellcome down 23p to 397 on further\nprofit-taking in the wake of adverse press comment on the side\neffects of its \"Retrovir\" aids drug. London International Group\ngained 13p to 301 as operators switched out of Wellcome.\n    Extel lost a net 26p to 464 in the wake of yesterday's news\nthat Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communications Corp\nwould not be making a bid for the company.\n    In a generally easier oil sector, BP fell 18p to 912 after\nyesterday's statement by Standard Oil that it considered BP's\n70 dlrs per share tender offer for the 45 pct of the company it\ndoes not already own as \"inadequate.\"\n    In banks, Standard Chartered lost 4p to 820 after its\nrecent gains on the back of bid rumours, but dealers noted\npress speculation that Australian businessman Robert Holmes\nA'Court had increased his stake in the company yesterday.\n    Many operators expect Lloyds bank to renew its offer for\nStandard once its one year bid limit ends in July, although\nsome dealers thought this unlikely. Lloyds gained 1p to 488.\n    Elsewhere, industrial group Norcros gained 9p to 448 on\nspeculation of a bid for the company, while food retailer Tesco\nadded 2p to 475 after extending its 151 mln stg contested bid\nfor Hillards Plc until May 1. Hillards was a penny up at 314.\n    Government bonds stood generally lower in late trading with\nprices drifting down on a lack of interest. Gilts gained around\n5/16 point at the outset on the back of the opinion polls.\n    Equities tended to move up in later quiet trading as Wall\nStreet rallied from its early lows. At 1556 GMT the FTSE 100\nwas down just 4.7 points at 1,984.9 after a low of 1,977.2 at\n1354 GMT.\n    Dealers said most in the market appear to expect share\nprices to move higher tomorrow, but volume will remain\nrelatively light ahead of an announcement of the election date.\n    They said given the thin trading conditions the market's\nmovements will be volatile in the coming few sessions.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Money market interest rates closed little\nchanged after a quiet session as yesterday's talk of lower U.K.\nBase lending rates fizzled out, dealers said.\n    Further opinion polls showing the ruling Conservative Party\nwell ahead had little effect on the market with operators\nlooking for more definite news on the political front. Sterling\ncontinued quietly steady ahead of the Group of Seven talks in\nWashington this week.\n    One senior money broker commented, \"What we want is an\nelection date to put a stop to all the speculation. Once the\nmarket knows what's happening then we can move forward.\"\n    The next move in U.K. Base rates, which now stand at 10\npct, is still expected to be down but uncertainty over the date\nof a general election is making for cautious trading, dealers\nsaid.\n    Yesterday, opinion polls showing the Government was set to\nretain a substantial working majority lifted sterling and\nfuelled speculation about lower U.K. Interest rates.\n    The British authorities are likely to remain cautious,\nhowever, as the G-7 finance ministers meeting is set to review\ntheir February Paris accord on currency stability. This could\naffect sterling which today was just one basis point lower in\ntrade weighted terms to stand at 72.3.\n    Dealers noted that longer dated paper again dominated the\nday-to-day dealings between the discount houses and the Bank of\nEngland. As rates fell yesterday, no band four bills, which\nhave a maturity of between two and three months were\ntransacted. Today, however, these again appeared but the\nmajority of the Bank's assistance was provided in the one to\ntwo months range.\n    The key one and three months interbank rates were unchanged\nquoted at 10-1/16 9-15/16 and 9-7/8 3/4 pct respectively. Until\nfresh economic or political news emerges, dealers say they\nexpect the market to continue around these levels with only\ntechnical factors provoking small fluctuations in rates.\n    The Bank of England forecast a 900 mln stg shortage in the\nsystem today but provided only 713 mln stg assistance. Despite\nthis, overnight interbank traded in the 11 to 10 pct range\nhaving started the day at around 10-1/4 10 pct.\n    Period interbank rates were little changed with six months\nquoted at 9-3/4 5/8 and one year at 9-5/8 1/2 pct.\n    Sterling CDs were also mostly steady with six and nine\nmonths ending the day at 9-9/16 7/16 pct and 9-1/2 3/8 pct\nrespectively. Eligible bank bill rates showed no change from\nlate yesterday with one month at 9-13/16 25/32 pct and three\nmonths at 9-17/32 15/32 pct.\n REUTER\n&#3;",
