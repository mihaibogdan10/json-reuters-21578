In return, Washington agreed to forego\nantidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors.\n    But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped\ndumping in the U.S. market, it has not ended third country\ndumping; nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors.\n    Japan yesterday, in an effort to ward off U.S. action,\nordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to\nforce prices up and end the dumping.\n    Bywater, in his statement, said he backed a Defense Science\nBoard task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new\nelectronic products and manufacturing processes and make the\nU.S. industory more competitive.\n    But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to\npass and that action was required now to help the depressed\nelectronic industry.\n    Bywater said, \"I urge the Reagan Administration to take full\nand severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the\nretaliatory steps that are permitted under U.S. law and GATT\n(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Central bank intervention in the\nforeign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's\nlosses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency\nis headed for a further retreat.\n    Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive\nthat the six major industrial nations have differing levels of\ncommitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.\n    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over\nthe currency market than central bank intervention and these\nargue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.\n    \"The market can be bigger than the central banks. And\neconomic fundamentals will always come to the fore,\" said a\ndealer at one major U.S. bank.\n    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the\nyen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,\nFederal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the\nmarkets on behalf of the U.S. currency.\n    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar\nrecover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from\nthe post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still\nfailed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.\n    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5\nbillion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars\nyesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.\n    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the\nFed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen\ntoday. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased\na small amount of dollars for yen.\n    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28\nwhen it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of\nJapan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have\nsignalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.\n    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February\n22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,\nFrance and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate\nto foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.\n    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by\nthe authorities' intervention which they said can only soften\nextreme moves in the market.\n    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's\npurchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than\nfor the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  \nwatered-down American commitment to the currency accord.\n    The Bank of England's action also was thought to be\ncompleted on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing\nthe market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six\nnations in its support of the currency pact.\n    \"No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other\ntwo central banks seem to be making more token gestures than\nanything else,\" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.\n    \"I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,\" said\nEarl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. \n\"It's a yen problem more than anything else.\"\n    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist\nsentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American\nauthorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.\n    \"The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the\nTreasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on\nits own account because of the strength of protectionism here,\"\nsaid Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.\n    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets\nare becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official\ndenials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a\nlower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.\n    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade\ndeficit in 1986 was with Japan.\n    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on\nSunday that the February currency pact had not established\ndollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the\nU.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.\n    \"The dollar still has more room on the downside against the\nyen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The\ncurrency market is becoming very political,\" said Natsuo Okada\nof Sumitomo Bank Ltd.\n    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen\nthis week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end\nof April or early May.\n    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their\neconomies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic\nimbalances in the near future, dealers said.\n    \"Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it\nwon't be enough to help the trade situation much,\" said\nBourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to\n148 yen in the next couple of days.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting\npower of the class B shares.\n    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made\nby Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.\n    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing\nclass A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of\nthe outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire\nResorts.\n    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the\nmerger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the\nspecial preferred stock would immediately be converted into\nexchangeable participating preferred of the new company.\n    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on\nthe net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island\noperations.\n    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a\ntwo-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it\nbecause it did not contain enough information. Resorts has\nasked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.\n    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but\nthat it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the\nDenver oilman.\n    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles\npublic relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was\nnot immediately available for comment.\n    Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a\nspokesman for the Crosby estate.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Analysts said 1987\ncorn production could drop by over one billion bushels to\naround seven billion bushels.\n    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains\nprogram, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation\nprogram, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain\nanalysts said.\n    \"There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in\ncorn acreage,\" one said. \"It's difficult for any farmer to not\ngo along with the program this year.\"\n    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but\nat a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.\n    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they\nsaid, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.\n    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the\ndrop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when\nfarmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.\n    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A\nsevere drought that summer in major producing states caused\nyields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2\nbillion bushels.\n    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts\nsaid the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion\nbushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.\n    \"This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant\nreduction in production,\" an analyst said.\n    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.\ncorn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not\nincrease significantly, a specialist said.\n    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the\ngreatest acreage reductions, based upon historical\nparticipation in government programs, analysts said.\n    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most\nin marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western\ncorn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.\n    \"Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,\"\nhe said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in\nhigher-producing delta areas.\n    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's\n2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.\n    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in\n1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has\nsteadily declined in the 1980's.\n    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in\nthe low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The\nhighest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has\nkept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln\nacres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.\n    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields\naveraging 119.3 bushels per acre.\n    \"We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion\nbushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,\" an analyst said.\n    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as\nlong as government program provisions remain the same, analysts\nsaid.\n    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to\nset aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible\nfor payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15\npct of their acreage.\n    \"To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to\nprovide more incentives,\" an analyst said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The refiners\nsaid the increase is needed because the quota is so restrictive\nthere could be some spot shortages of sugar in the U.S later\nthis year, a refiner spokesman said.\n    However, the official slaid the USDA replied only that it\nwould consider the request.\n    Following the refiners' request, representatives of the\nFlorida sugarcane producers met with USDA to express opposition\nto any quota expansion, industry sources said.\n    The statement by Huckaby, who as a representative from a\nsugar growing district in Louisiana is a leading architect of\nthe current sugar program, indicates at least some grower\nofficials are concerned enough to support an easing of the\nimport quota, industry officials said.\n    Any final decision on easing the quota must be made by the\nReagan administration's interagency sugar policy group.\n    Asked about possible quota changes, A USDA official said\n\"As far as I know, changing the quota volume or the quota year\nis not under active consideration.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Potash\nproducers from New Mexico, claiming unfair government\nsubsidies, are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada's shipments.\n    Canada, the world's largest potash producer, exported 9.8\nmln metric tonnes of potash last year, with nearly a third\ngoing to the U.S.\n    Most of the potash, used in the production of fertilizer,\ncomes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan.\n    In the Commons, Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the\nruling as just another \"trade harrassment\" from the U.S. and\ncriticized Clark's assurances the country's interests would be\nprotected.\n    \"We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the\nsoftwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled,\"\nAxworthy said.\n    Canada's Progressive Conservative government agreed to\nimpose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier\nthis year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with\nthe U.S.\n    Axworthy urged the government to present Canada's case to\nworld trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade.\n    But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example\nof why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral\nirritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the\nU.S.\n    \"What we are seeking to do is put in place a better\nsystem,\" Clark said.\n    Meanwhile, Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed\nconfidence Canada would win its case, claiming the problem\nstems from low international commodity prices and not\ngovernment subsidies.\n    \"The reality of the problem and the injury is caused\nworldwide,\" he said. \"It's caused by a downturn in the\ncommodity price for fertilizer, whether it's potash fertilizer,\nnitrogen fertilizer or whatever.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Automobile dealerships have become\nlarge, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1\nbillion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.\n    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and\nbuyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the\nlargest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts\nsay.\n    Retail car sales \"are at a point of transition. There's not\nmuch that's off the table in terms of creative thinking\" about\nways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University\nof Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.\n    The retail car market is \"much more freeform now\" than it\nwas in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit\nanalyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.\n    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.\nDealerships sold one kind of car--a \"Chevy\" or a Ford or a\nStudebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold\n738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National\nAutomobile Dealers Association.\n    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen\nBeatle--began to gain popularity. The \"Bug\" caused \"a\nrebellion\" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from\nrestrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,\nsays Jauppi.\n    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has\nbeen in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,\nthe average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold\nincrease from 1956--and employed 34 workers.\n    \"I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln\ndlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,\"\nsays Cole.\n    \"There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that\nmake cars,\" he says.\n    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying\nup other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend\nwill let up.\n    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.\nPower, a California-based market research firm, says that, by\n1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800\nprincipal owners today.\n    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several\nfranchises, some of which might compete against each other. \"It\nused to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a\nChevrolet dealer might handle several lines,\" Jauppi says.\n    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about\nthe possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned\nor open international operations.\n    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,\n\"are obviously thinking of very seriously,\" says Cole.\n    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way\nof a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to\ntrading in car dealer shares.\n    \"Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing\nthe manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those\ncars. It could happen any time,\" Jauppi says.\n    \"If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the\nscale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to\nresist taking them public,\" said another analyst.\n    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become\ninternational.\n    \"We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks\nthat are worldwide,\" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted\nparticularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster\nthan the U.S., he says.\n    \"It's not totally off the wall,\" says Cole.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Banks had been pressing Brazil to\nmake at least a token interest payment, but Gros said the\ngovernment was unable to comply for the moment.\n    He stressed however that Brazil was willing to pay as soon\nas it could, but added that a payment of interest was not\nconnected with the extension of the credit lines.\n    \"That would not be wise,\" he said.\n    He said that the extension of the short-term lines would\nnot be carried out through \"an official instrument\" as there was\nnot time to complete the legal requirements.\n    Gros said Brazil was likely to meet again with the 14-bank\nadvisory committee once Brazil had information to present on an\neconomic plan.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Analysts said Jardine will book\nrevenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the\nyear as part of its retail business, which will increase its\noverall retail income figures.\n    Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply\nincreased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct\nshare of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.\n    Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986\nof 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.\n    Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments\nof about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln\ndlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about\nthe 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.\n    But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln\ndlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.\n    Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations\nthat will in effect turn it into a holding company for its\ndiverse interests.\n    It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both\nHong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine\nStrategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.\n    A company statement issued last month said the firm will\nuse the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an\nadditional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.\n    Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake\nin the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is\nlikely to develop its own business, analysts said.\n    \"The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability\nto creatively structure some new acquisitions,\" said Hargreaves\nof Hoare Govett.\n    He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key\nsector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its\nexisting business.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Deposits and interbank borrowings\nrose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.\n    Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent\ncompany rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen\nInternational Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso\nInternational Bank Ltd> in Macao.\n    The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985\nbut did not officially open until March 1986.\n    Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign\npartner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut\nlast year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign\nbanks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three\nChinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.\n    Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were\nunfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a\nloss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of\n268,000 dlrs in 1985.\n    The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of\nChina, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,\nFujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and\nXiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).\n    One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the\nsame problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on\nunequal terms with state-owned banks.\n    The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost\nsaturated, he added.\n    Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted\nfrom contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the\nforeign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced\ninternal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.\n    Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International\nAgricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the\nstate-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight\nforeign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong\nKong or overseas Chinese banks.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He said the negotiated structure works against small\ninvestors, who play an important role in the market.\n    The market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange of\nSingapore increased to 42 billion U.S. Dlrs in January 1987\nfrom 32 billion U.S. Dlrs in early 1986, he said.\n    Teo said the government has picked 15 companies to\nparticipate in a privatisation program which strives to create\nopportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrs\nworth of shares a year. It will try to increase alternative\ninvestment available to investors, he said.\n    He cautioned against problems in a more competitive\nsecurities market, adding that the possibility of insider\ntrading is increased when securities dealing, corporate finance\nand investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof.\nBut he said the future direction of Singapore's securities\nindustry will be dictated by international trends.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

There would be a grave crisis in\nEurope's scientific and research policy,\" Verhofstadt said,\nadding it could mean research teams being disbanded.\n    Diplomats said West Germany was close to agreeing to the\ncompromise, which would limit new spending to 5.4 billion Ecus\nby allowing for cash already set aside for future projects.\n    The plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 5.4\nbillion Ecus for spending after the end of the five-year\nprogram, they said. But Britain still maintained the\nallocations were much too high.\n    Britain's Research Minister Geoffrey Pattie faced a tough\nfight to convince his government colleagues they should accept\nan increase in spending beyond the 4.2 billion Ecu level so far\ndemanded by Britain, one diplomat added.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Middle East currency dealers meet in\nAbu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their\nbusiness, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from\nthe Arab world to London.\n    The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association\nalso comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf\ncurrency system is more real that at any time this decade.\n    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these\nissues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to\nbe major talking points.\n    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --\nincluding some in London and other major non-Arab financial\ncentres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins\non on Saturday.\n    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a\ngrowing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,\nby far the largest in the region, is being carried out in\nLondon.\n    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,\nforeign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in\nBahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based\nbanks are boosting their treasury operations in London.\n    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade\nfinance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain\nran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.\nClearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.\n    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab\nBanking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased\ntheir presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading\nrepresentative offices to branch status to allow dealing.\n    One economist said: \"It is cheaper to run a riyal book in\nLondon than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...\nThere is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.\"\n    Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit\ntaker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,\n&lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November\n1986.\n    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based\nconsortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom\njoint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its\nLondon operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.\n    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: \"Inevitably the\nvolume of business in London has gained pace with the two new\nlicences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most\nof the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.\"\n    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi\nriyal market is difficult to quantify.\n    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency\ndeposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped\nto the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986\nfrom 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.\n    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal\ntrading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very\nquiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now\nstaff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect\n&lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.\n    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market\nmoving completely out of the region, partly because of local\ndemand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate\ninternationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue\nspeculation.\n    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market\nshifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain\nand London is still limited.\n    But for the first time since the formation of the six\nnation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs\nthat a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.\n    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final\ncurrency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.\n    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary\nSystem style with a common peg have been discussed at high\nlevel and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected\nto be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.\n    One dealer said: \"A lot of exposure is being given to\ndiscussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the\nend a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\n    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\n    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\nsince the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently\nlinked to a basket of currencies while the other five\ncurrencies are either officially or in practice linked to the\nU.S. Dollar.\n    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation\nagainst the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,\nbut plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of\n7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.\n    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued\nslide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the\nundermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

New measures have been introduced to\nboost the private sector and attract foreign investment.\n    A higher proportion of foreign ownership, even up to 100\npct, is now possible for new investments in the manufacturing\nsector made between October 1986 and December 1990, he said.\n    \"The long term prospects of the Malaysian economy are bright\n... Indications are already available to show that the economy\nis recovering and that growth will be positive and stronger\nthan originally expected,\" Azraai said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "China must cut excess demand and capital\ninvestment in the face of budget and foreign exchange deficits\nbut will press ahead with wide-ranging economic reforms in\n1987, Premier Zhao Ziyang told parliament.\n    Zhao told the annual meeting of the National People's\nCongress that while China cooled its overheated economy, cut\nits trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,\nserious imbalances remain.\n    Zhao said total social demand exceeds total supply, and\ndemand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is too\nhigh. \"(They) squander public funds to a serious extent ... (and\nissue) excessive wage and bonus increases,\" he said.\n    Failure to cut this excess will \"result in reduced\naccumulation of funds...And serve to corrupt social morality,\"\nZhao said. He said there was a contradiction between low per\ncapita incomes and excessively high consumer demand.\n    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction\nin its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption\nmust match the available resources, he said.\n    Zhao said there was a deficit in state finances in 1986\nbecause of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost\nof foreign exchange earnings through exports, reduced income\nfrom customs duties and unreasonably heavy spending.\n    Local authorities, departments and firms have been able to\nretain more revenue since economic reforms in 1979. \"(They)\nunjustifiably developed processing industries and\nnon-productive construction,\" Zhao said.\n    He said that unless effective measures are taken to curb\nthis practice, financial and credit deficits are likely to\nincrease in the next few years.\n    Zhao said that if such deficits become excessive and last\ntoo long, they will cause the over-issue of money, which in\nturn will cause \"disturbing inflation, a precipitous rise in\ncommodity prices and chaos in economic life.\"\n    Another serious problem is that too many new construction\nprojects have been launched. Fixed asset investment outside the\nstate plan is over-extended and the pattern of such investment\nis highly irrational, he said.\n    Investment in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw\nand semi-finished materials industries is inadequate and\ninvestment in non-productive projects is too large, he said.\n     Zhao said some departments and local authorities have\nfailed to take prompt and effective measures to correct this\ninvestment imbalance, despite instructions to do so from the\nState Council earlier this year.\n     He said China's per capita output of grain and other farm\nand sideline products is still very low and production of\ngrain, forestry, animal husbandry and fisheries rests on a\nrather weak foundation.\n     China's countryside is still in the development stage and\nthere is vast potential to be tapped through deep reforms, he\nsaid, but did not elaborate.\n    Zhao said the main task for reform in 1987 is to breathe\nlife into China's large and medium sized state firms, which\nstill do not have \"a satisfactory combination of\nresponsibilities, powers and benefits.\"\n    \"We have yet to create conditions for giving the enterprises\nfull managerial authority and full responsibility for their own\nprofits and losses,\" he said.\n    Currently, the firms are not responding rationally to\nmarket changes and doing all the state requires of them, he\nsaid. Their potential is not being fully tapped, he added.\n    Zhao said that in 1987, China will speed up the reform of\nits financial system, diversify credit services, encourage\ncompetition among different financial institutions and promote\ninsurance services.\n    He said the system of bank interest rates must be reformed,\nwith differential and floating rates being applied for\ndifferent periods of time.\n    China must, under proper guidance, develop markets for the\ncirculation of funds in major cities and exploit the role of\nfinancial markets in pooling and regulating funds, he added.\n    Zhao said China must also expand the market for capital\ngoods such as rolled steel, coal, cement and timber. The lack\nof such a market is the main reason why large state firms have\n\"yet to be fully invigorated,\" he said.\n    He also promised a continuation of the labour contract\nsystem under which all firms hire workers for a fixed period\nand pay them according to their own methods, subject only to\nstate-set ceilings for wages and bonuses.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The investment was mainly in\nelectronics, trading, food and service industries.\n    Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial\nDevelopment and Investment Centre, said the forecast rise is\ndue to planned government incentives and growing willingness\namong Taiwanese to invest abroad.\n    Lee told Reuters the incentives, to be introduced in May or\nJune, include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation\nrequirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10\nmln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln.\n    He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are\npart of Taiwan's efforts to cut its trade surplus with\nWashington, which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in\n1986 from 1985's 10.2 billion.\n    Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and\navoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U.S., He\nadded.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Headquarters in\nNew York from May 1 to December 31 this year and will enter\ninto force provisionally when ratified by countries accounting\nfor 75 pct of world rubber exports and 75 pct of world imports.\n    Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik said\nthe formal adoption of a new pact had dispelled fears of\nliquidation of some 360,000 tonnes of INRA buffer stock rubber\nand a possible depression of prices.\n    He expressed confidence that the new INRA would continue to\nkeep prices stable by selling or buying rubber as prices rose\nor fell through its buffer stock system.\n    Malaysia was also happy that in the new INRA financing of\npurchases for the normal buffer stock of 400,000 tonnes and a\ncontingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes would be done\nthrough direct cash contributions from members, he said.\n    Under the existing pact, members can borrow from banks to\nfinance INRA's buffer stock purchases. This has been viewed\nwith concern by some members who fear the INRA may become\nindebted and ultimately face collapse, like the International\nTin Agreement.\n    \"This will ensure the buffer stock operation is carried out\nwithout any financial encumbrance,\" Lim said.\n     Malaysia, the world's largest producer, was seeking\ncabinet approval to join the new INRA and hoped other producers\nand consumers would also become members, he said.\n    Officials in Jakarta said the new pact would bring benefit\nto Indonesia's rubber industry's by stabilising prices.\n    It was unlikely to collapse like the tin agreement because\nits new financial provisions had been tightened, they said.\n    Thai officials told Reuters they were optimistic the new\npact was viable because it strictly limited the extent of debt\nthe INRA buffer stock manager might commit to his market\noperations.\n     Malaysian growers, however, said they preferred a free\nrubber market because an INRA had a tendency to keep prices at\nlevels that were only acceptable to consumers.\n    \"With the INRA's ability to keep prices at a certain stable\nlevel, consumers are assured of rubber at almost a fixed price,\nwhile producers may never see sharp price rises,\" a Malaysian\nRubber Producers Council source told Reuters.\n    Producers also wanted a free rubber market without the\noverhang of a 360,000 tonne INRA buffer stock which had\npsychologically prevented price rises, he said.\n    State plantation officials in Sri Lanka said prices had\nbeen depressed since INRA's inception and the creation of a\nbuffer stock, and they seemed unlikely to rise.\n    Sri Lanka should not be a member of the INRA because it was\nexpensive to maintain a buffer stock, they added.\n    Traders in the region, meanwhile, said prices might be\npressured by the new pact in the long term as its potential to\nstabilise prices and buffer stock capacity would spur producers\nto produce more.\n    Most Malaysian and Singapore traders said the new pact's\nconclusion had little impact on prices and it was unlikely to\nallow sharp price fluctuations in future.\n    \"The 360,000 tonnes in the INRA buffer stock must be\nliquidated and a free market returned,\" a Malaysian trader said.\n    Japanese traders said the new pact had a chance for success\nas most world producers and consumers had adopted it, but they\nquestioned the ability of some financially-strapped producers\nto finance buffer stock operations.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "London's rise as a trading centre for\nU.S. Government debt has been spurred by the increasing use of\ninterest rate swaps, which are now arranged for most new issues\nin the eurobond markets, traders and analysts said.\n    Indeed, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all\nnew debt issued here last year -- over 186 billion dlrs worth\n-- was part of either an interest rate or currency swap.\n    \"The U.S. Treasuries market here is swap-driven,\" said David\nJones, vice president at Goldman Sachs and Co international and\nhead of its U.S. Government bond trading desk.\n    \"It is commonplace to have trades of 100 mln dlrs or more in\n10-years, seven years or five years, all related to an interest\nrate swap or hedging of a eurobond deal,\" Jones said at a recent\nconference on the U.S. Treasuries market.\n    Just a year or so ago, he said, trades of that size going\nthrough brokers screens in London were unthinkable.\n    Traders said that over the past two weeks, while trading in\nU.S. Treasuries has been almost frozen by indecision over the\ndirection of interest rates, swap-related deals have provided\nthe sole source of new business.\n    Dealers said that last week, a 260 mln dlr trade involving\ntwo and 10-year Treasuries was transacted on brokers' screens.\n    The trade, they said, was swap related.\n    There are no firm figures on exactly how much U.S. Treasury\ndebt is traded here and estimates vary widely.\n    But Wrightson Economics, a U.S.-based research firm which\ndrew its data from U.S. Treasury reports, estimated that gross\ntransactions in U.S. Government securities in London rose to\n341 billion dlrs in the first nine months of 1986 alone,\nagainst 188 billion in all of 1985.\n    Wrightson estimates that about 20 pct of all U.S. Treasury\ntrading is transacted outside the U.S., With Tokyo forming the\nthird major centre.\n    And while figures are not yet available for the last\nquarter, the anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend\ncontinued, traders say.\n    Richard Lacy, chief executive at Exco International, put\naverage daily Treasuries trading volume in London at about 15\nbillion dlrs. Exco recently purchased an 80 pct interest in RMJ\nSecurities inc, one of the four major brokers in U.S.\nGovernment bonds which has offices in London, New York and\nTokyo.\n    But Dick Van Splinter, president of RMJ's competitor,\nFundamental Brokers Inc's London operations, estimates average\ndaily turnover is no more than four to five billion dlrs.\n    But even at the low range of estimates, Treasuries trading\nvolume is at least equal to that in the U.K.'s own government\nbonds, known as gilts.\n     Jeremy Ford, vice president at Bankers Trust International\nLtd, explained that U.S. Treasuries are used by intermediaries\nin swap transactions to lock in the \"spread,\" the difference\nbetween the interest rate the borrower has to pay and the rate\nthat the counterparty is obliged to pay.\n    But even beyond swap-related activity, dealers said the\nnature of trading in London has changed.\n    \"The interesting thing our figures show is the transition in\nLondon from a marketing effort to a trading effort,\" said Louis\nCrandall, an economist at Wrightson who has been collecting the\ndata.\n    Crandall said that previously, firms' activities were\nlimited to trying to sell U.S. Securities to European\ninvestors. Now, however, they appear increasingly willing act\nas principal in transactions rather than acting on behalf of\ntheir New York offices.\n    Increasingly, traders say, firms maintain separate profit\nand loss sheets for their London operations so that trading\ndecisions can be made independently from the U.S. Headquarters.\n    Many of the major U.S. Firms, including Merrill Lynch and\nCo, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc and Chemical Bank trade for\ntheir own accounts here.\n    Also, traders point out, the number of U.S. Firms operating\nin London has increased sharply over the past year, as has the\nnumber of European and Asian banks which trade U.S. Government\nsecurities.\n    Within the past few months, National\nWestminster Bank Plc's County Bank subsidiary and Swiss Bank\nCorp have applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to\nbecome primary dealers in U.S. Government securities and their\nLondon offices have just recently received direct-dealing\nbrokers screens.\n    And Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, already a primary dealer, is\npreparing to open a U.S. Treasuries trading desk in London.\n    Dick Van Splinter, president of Fundamental Brokers Inc,\nthe largest of the four major government bond brokers here,\nsaid he now has 45 firms using direct-dealing screens, up from\n35 a year ago.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "The chances of U.K. Stocks continuing\nrecent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertainties\nof a probable election are small, and market analysts say there\nwill probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.\n    The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the New\nYear, with the FT-SE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5\npct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.\n    \"Over the next month or two the odds are that the index will\ndrop back to around 1,900,\" said John Goldschmidt, head of\nequities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.\n    \"A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fall\nbefore the 1983 election when the Conservatives were further\nahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14\ninstead of 18 now,\" noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.\n    \"The old adage is \"sell in May and go away'. That's likely to\napply this year but will probably start in April,\" he added.\n    But few analysts believed a correction would spell the end\nof the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.\n    \"As long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growing\nthen the pressure for continued rises will be there. There\nseems little prospect of the growth stopping in 1987/1988,\" one\nsaid.\n    Much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief,\nalready virtually discounted, that the ruling Conservatives\nwill call an election in the next few months - probably June -\nand sweep home to a third term in office.\n    Even if this does happen, however, pre-election nerves are\nlikely to produce the traditional effect of damping down the\nmarket until the result is clear.\n    \"It's likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidence\nabout the Tories winning an overall majority,\" Goldschmidt said.\n    \"It would be quite out of character for the market to\ncontinue to sail serenely upwards right through the election\nand beyond,\" added brokers Phillips and Drew in a recent report.\n    The belief that the government itself is worried about the\nimpact of the Alliance party disrupting the usual two-corner\nfight of Conservative and Labour with unpredictable results, is\nnot likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.\n    Other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerable\nto a downwards correction. U.K. Stocks had ridden up partly on\nthe back of record rises in New York and Japan and a pause in\neither suggests that London would inevitably follow suit.\n    There would also be little new encouragement provided by\ngeneral economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news,\nincluding this month's half point cut in base rates to 10 pct,\nis already built into prices.\n    \"The economy is looking okay, but it can't support 20 pct\nincreases every three months indefinitely,\" one said.\n    Also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind the\nrecent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure of\nthe government's privatisation campaign.\n    The next few months will see cash calls for second tranche\npayments on British Gas Plc &lt;BRGS.L> and British Airways Plc\n&lt;BAB.L> as well as the proposed sale of &lt;Rolls Royce Plc> and\nthe as-yet untimetabled sale of the government's 31.7 pct stake\nin British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.\n    On top of that, there will be calls from the gilt market\neven though last week's budget limited the projected 1987/88\nborrowing requirement to four billion stg.\n    \"We are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and that's not\nincluding rights issues which have been low so far this year\nand may pick up in the second quarter,\" Knight said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Upon exercising the \"A\" warrants, investors also\nget two warrants for the \"B\" series.\n    The \"A\" exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,\n1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.\n    Of the two \"B\" warrants, one entitles investors to purchase\none participation certificate in Inspectorate International AG\nand the other provides seven warrants.\n    Investors may pay for \"B\" participation certificates by\nredeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issued\nin denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixed\nprice of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.\n    Participation certificates acquired with \"B\" warrants will be\npriced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,\nplus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the \"B\" series is\nfrom August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.\n    Fees for the bond total 2-1/4 pct, with 1-1/2 points for\nselling, and 1-3/4 for management and underwriting combined.\n    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bond\npays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,\n1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.\n    If all participation share warrants are exercised, the\ncompany will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.\n    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lower\ncost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the\nInspectorate equity through issues of participation\ncertificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.\n    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a\n51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,\nand other recent acquisitions.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

In addition, the bourse, options\nand gold futures price lists will be merged this April.\n    Transactions in Amsterdam are still processed with a now\noutdated punch card system while price information stemming\nfrom the larger off-floor deals done through AIM are not yet\nintegrated in the bourse's big board.\n    A bourse spokesman said the exchange hoped to launch its\nscreen information service by 1989, but added this service did\nnot have first priority.\n    At present, bourse price information and company\ninformation announced by the bourse are published by a printer\nservice while a select number of prices is available via\nteletext.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The agreement extends a standstill\narrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since\nAugust, 1985.\n    Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed\ntheir private estimates and could be comfortably met by the\nmonetary authorities.\n    \"They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we\noffered the minimum,\" said one banking source, reacting to\nreports from London that creditors were hoping for larger\nrepayments.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa\nshould have \"no difficulty whatsoever\" with the terms.\n    Economists said the debt agreement would have no\nsignificant impact on economic problems continuing to face\nSouth Africa including high rates of inflation and\nunemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.\n    Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking\nyesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was \"in\nbad shape\" and there was \"an awful lot of talk but little action\"\nto cure serious problems.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

In 1986 it\nreported revenue of 55 mln Canadian dlrs with a pretax loss of\n1.6 mln compared with a 1.9 mln profit in 1985.\n    However, Sharp said that internal accounts showed the\ncompany was in profit in the first two months of 1987.\n    End-1986 net assets totalled 11.85 mln dlrs.\n    A Reuters statement said the acquisition would fit\nperfectly into its package for the banking and securities\nindustries.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But Unisys has not lost any\ncustomers currently using its 1190 mainframes because of the\nwait for the new products, he said.\n    At the press conference, Kroger said Unisys is not\ndeveloping a one-megabit computer memory chip but will probably\nbuy them when appropriate from Japanese suppliers.     In\nresponse to a question, Kroger indicated first quarter orders\nshould be up from a year ago, with international business good\nand the U.S. market still \"difficult.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Energy Secretary John Herrington has\nproposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said\nall would cost the Treasury money and will come under close\nWhite House scrutiny before action is taken.\n    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion\nallowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as\nproduction using enhanced extraction methods.\n    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.\nThe White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the\ntax code, but would look at the proposal.\n    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along\nwith the release last week of the energy department's report on\nenergy and the national security.\n    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit\n50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging\nimplications for national security.\n    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that\nany plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production\nwould have to meet three criteria--increase production, not\ncause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.\n    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,\nspurring production but fail the second and third.\n    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil \nworkers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil\nprices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide\nand cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.\n    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria\nby not increasing domestic production.\n    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains\nfirmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.\n    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:\n    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by\nborrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if\noil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\ncould cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\n    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\nwould raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\nbarrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\n    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\nexpenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\nday, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\n    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\nspur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for\nthe typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower\nthe cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.\n    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration\nproposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut\nthe need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.\n    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore\noff the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion\nbarrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which\nmay hold nine billion barrels.\n    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to \namend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these\nproposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security\nstudy would make a strong case for the need to help the\nstruggling domestic oil industry.\n    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even\nthough it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to\nraise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to\n100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.\n    This, he said, would further bolster national security in\ncase of an oil-supply disruption.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",

Huckaby, chairman\nof the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar\nissues, told Reuters in an interview.\n    Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year\nthey must halt production increases, said he will deliver the\nsame message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also\nsaid he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.\n    Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic\nsweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further\ncuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.\n    \"I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota)\nanother half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point\nwhere the program might not work,\" he said.\n    \"Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,\"\nsaid Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.\n    A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the\ncurrent level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the\nU.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports\nholding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.\n    A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made\nuntil 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.\n    \"I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could\nprobably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through\nthe 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"\nHuckaby said.\n    However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup\nproducers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener\nmarket from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.\n    He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will\ncapture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in\nthe U.S.\n    But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the\nproduction of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further\nexpanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports\nmight be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.\n    Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner\ncompanies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.\n    \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have\nsome natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the\nprogram is preserved,\" Huckaby said.\n    Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to\nthink about how domestic output could be controlled, either\nthrough production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.\n    Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the\nJustice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask\ncorn refiners to limit production.\n    \"I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do\nthere's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do\nthat legally?\" he said.\n    Asked if he would proceed with production controls without\nthe support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile\nhouse if you do it that way.\"\n    Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers\nhave expanded production, because high sugar price support\nmeans returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such\nas soybeans and grain.\n    But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would\nnot be good policy.\n    Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to\nsugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they\nmay be penalized retroactively under any production control\nlegislation passed next year.\n    Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in\nthe sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration\nproposal to drastically slash the program.\n    \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't\nthink it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.\n    He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price\nsupport is unlikely to be approved.\n    Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,\nHuckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint\nwith the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the\nEuropean Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the\nmajor cause of the depressed world sugar market.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Before December\n31, 1988, it will not apply to dividends paid before the date\nof the announcement of such action.

The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1\nmln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.\n    Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods\nin the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe\nprovinces and northern Buenos Aires.\n    The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures\nand inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty\npods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.\n    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to\n3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86\nrecord of 3.34 mln hectares.\n    The state of the crop continued to be good in general until\nlast week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused\ndamage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.\n    Where the rains were less heavy they were considered\nbeneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.\n    The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in\nsouthern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to\ninfluence production forecasts.\n    In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where\nrainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize\nand sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.\n    The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by\nrains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La\nPampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.\n    The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and\n3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln\nhectares in 1985/86.\n    The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at\nbetween 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.\n    This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to\n12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production\nand 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.\n    The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the\narea sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires\nalthough at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.\n    A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is\nimpossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of\nsunshine dries the fields.\n    The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down\n29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.\n    Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3\nto 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of\n4.1 mln tonnes.\n    The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the\nrains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting\nin La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.\n    The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2\npct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.\n    Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to\n22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "UAL Inc's diversification into hotels\nand rental cars may be its downfall, analysts said.\n    Digesting its acquisitions of hotels, Pan Am Corp's Pacific\nair routes, and Hertz rental cars, combined with stiff air fare\ncompetition has left the company with an undervalued stock\nprice, analysts said.\n    The vulnerability of UAL's stock has fueled takeover\nspeculation, as have reports that real estate magnate Donald\nTrump has bought a large amount of its stock.\n    Today, a UAL executive told Reuters its chairman Richard\nFerris spoke with Trump last week. Trump said his interest in\nthe stock was as an investment, but the executive said the\ncompany does not know how much Trump owns or whether he has any\nother plans.\n    UAL senior vice president Kurt Stocker said the company\nbelieves its diversification strategy will work since it can\nfeed customers from one business to another. Several weeks ago,\nit announced the new name of Allegis, to be taken in May.\n    \"The strategy that Dick Ferris was talking about a couple\nweeks ago when we announced the Allegis name is that the whole\nreally ends up to be worth more than the sum of the parts.\nUnfortunately, some people haven't really come to this\nunderstanding,\" Stocker said.\n    But those same parts - Westin Hotels, Hertz rental cars,\nUnited Airlines and its reservation system - also has Wall\nStreet calculating a wide range of breakup values from about\n100 dlrs per share to 130 dlrs per share.\n    Analysts aren't so sure the strategy is going to work. They\nmention Transworld Corp, initially Trans World Airlines,\nas an example of an airline diversification gone wrong.\nTransworld Corp ended up spinning off its TWA airline.\nTransworld, now TW Services, is selling Hilton International to\nUAL.\n    \"If you want to be negatively biased you say it's a stupid\nphilosophy, and if you're United and you put billions of dlrs\ninto other acquisitions, this is a good idea. There's not much\nevidence one way or the other,\" said Dean Witter analyst Mark\nDaugherty.\n    \"In the short or long run, they all (UAL's businesses) make\nmoney and perform well,\" said Stocker. He said the stock price\nhasn't caught on since the strategy is relatively new.\n    Analysts say it's because earnings are relatively poor.\nEarnings last year were 25 cts per share. Louis Marckesano of\nJanney Montgomery predicts 1987 net of 3.50 dlrs per share.\n    \"They're potential is enormous. I think their problem has\nbeen execution. The strike was the single biggest factor that\nset them back in 1985. Last year, the whole industry was\ninvolved in fare wars. They were hit harder by the fare wars\nthan anyone else,\" said Marckesano.\n    Marckesano said United Airlines was particularly hurt by\nthe fare wars because it shares a Denver hub with Texas Air\nCorp's price-slashing Continental Airlines.\n    Analysts said the same strategy which has contributed to an\nundervalued stock price may also result in a strong takeover\ndefense. They said UAL paid a lot for some of its assets and\nthat in itself may make the company undesireable.\n    \"I think they have a fairly tough management that will at\nleast be able to do battle with a potential shark and may well\nbe able to defeat them. These guys aren't pushovers,\" said\nSteve Lewins, an airline analyst at Citicorp.\n    Lewins believes the company could ultimately boost the\nstock price to a level that would reflect its assets, but it\nwill take time and improvements in earnings.\n    \"If they put their nose to the grindstone, we're talking\nabout years for anyone (in the airline industry),\" he said.\n\"The whole unwinding of the battle of Texas Air is going to\ntake years, establishing the Pacific in competition with (NWA\nInc &lt;NWA>) Northwest is going to take until 1990,\" Lewins said.\n     UAL today rose 2-1/2 to 62-1/2 on heavy volume of 1.9 mln\nshares.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Hyperinfltion has been curbed and public spending\ntrimmed, but the country's debt still trades as low as 10 cts\non the dollar on the secondary market, and many banks have\nwritten off most, if not all, of their loans to the country.\n    Few bankers see little chance for a subtantive recovery in\nBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what\nthey can on the loans.\n    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a\nmarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a\nhigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as an\nopportunity to cut their losses.\n    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that\nforeign goernments, especially the United States and West\nGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca\ncrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.\n    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops\ninstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,\nNogales said.\n    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four\npct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased\nto pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n\nimpact on inflation, he added.\n    Nogales said he does not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase\nto become a model for other debtors in dire straits. \"We're not\nseeking a universal solution,\" he said.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to\nmaintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move\nwould be too costly.\n    \"There will be alot of other options that will be\nconsidered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz\nproposal,\" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan\n(R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.\n    \"Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers\nwould not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean\nloan,\" O'Conner said.\n    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and\ndecide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr\nbasic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to\nincrease soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.\nThad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a\nsoybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or\n4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

More than 50 pct of the banks must give their\napproval, and Nogales said he is confident that this threshold\nwill be reached.\n    \"It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clear\nmajority,\" Nogales said.\n    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks\nare responding positively and said all the legal waivers\nnecessary could be obtained within two months.\n    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in\nMarch 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending\ntrimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the\ndollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off\nmost, if not all, of their loans to the country.\n    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in\nBolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what\nthey can on the loans.\n    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a\nmarket price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a\nhigher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as a\nwindow of opportunity to cut their losses.\n    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that\nforeign governments, especially the United States and West\nGermany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca\ncrops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.\n    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops\ninstead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,\nNogales said.\n    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four\npct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased\nto pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n\nimpact on inflation, he added.\n    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase to\nbecome a model for other debtors in dire straits. \"We're not\nseeking a universal solution,\" he said.\"             \n Reuter\n&#3;",

Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning\nfor reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements\nwith the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and\nother railroads, adds to the value of the merger.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

GenCorp\ngained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.\n    Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his\ngroup wins control.

Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansas\nonly had rain, he said.\n    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Association\nsaid, \"There's no question that baby calves coming in that kind\nof blizzard are probably not going to make it.\"\n    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were out\ncalving before the storm hit, he added.\n    The worst part of the storm came through the center of the\nstate. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow and\nsome feedlots are already like \"soup\", he said, inhibiting\ncattle movements.\n    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of larger\nanimals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mud\nmade it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it was\navailable.\n    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutback\nhas occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, which\nmay or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.\nCattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25\nduring the worst of the blizzard, he said.\n    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snow\nmelts. Mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangers\nsmaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The cost\nof feeding rises as animals generally consume more in cold\nweather, Domer said.\n    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards get\nback to normal.\n    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that although\nthe worst of the storm is over, there are still some strong\ngusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.\n    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and is\njust now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,\nparts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.\n    Snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inches\nin most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before moving\nnorth. This equals 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches of water. Drifts of four\nto six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.\n    There's a possibility of another storm brushing that region\ntomorrow night and Friday, Gallant added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Nobel of Sweden.\n    The settlement was also the largest in history in a\nbankruptcy case involving environmental issues, Freeman said.\n    Other companies with Superfund disputes are watching the\ncase closely, he said. \"There are a number of very large\ncorporations talking to the attorney general,\" Freeman said,\nreferring to Michigan Atty. Gen. Frank J. Kelley.\n    Freeman would not identify the companies involved, saying\nhe was not sure whether confidentiality agreements had been\nmade.\n    Lomac will pay 25-26 mln dlrs in the settlement. Five mln\ndlrs will be paid to the federal and 12 mln dlrs will go to the\nMichigan government for cleanup at the site, the Lakeway\nChemical plant.\n    The remaining funds will go to medical surveillance of\nformer workers at the plant.\n    Under the agreement, a trust fund will be set up \"to\nmonitor the health of employees who may have been exposed to\ndangerous chemicals that were manufactured at the plant before\n1971,\" the Michigan attorney general's office said in a\nstatement.\n    Freeman said the medical fund was necessary because of\npossible medical problems among workers at the site.\n    The Muskegon facility was formerly used to manufacture\ndyes. Freeman said Bofors Nobel spent 50 mln dlrs cleaning up\nthe site, formerly owned by Lakeway Chemical Co, before \"the\neconomic decision was made in Sweden\" to place the operation in\nbankruptcy.\n    Under the agreement, Bofors Nobel will sell the site, which\nstill holds an operating chemical plant, to Lomac. Some 150\nemployees work at the plant, a spokesman for the Michigan\nattorney general said.\n    The state attorney general said cleanup at the site will\nbegin \"immediately,\" and will be supervised by federal and\nstate officials.\n    Freeman said the plant site is not presently listed on the\nfederal superfund list, which qualifies the toxic waste site\nfor federal cleanup funds.\n    He said federal officials will try to get the Muskegon\nfacility onto the superfund list. If they are unable to do so,\nthe 5.0 mln dlr federal portion of the settlement will be\nturned over to Michigan officials to be used in the cleanup,\nFreeman said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The GAO then decided to\nre-examine the costs, sources said.\n    The issue is an important one, because congressional budget\ncommittees are known to be considering limiting the use of\ncertificates as a means of cutting spending.\n    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior\nAssociate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the\nSenate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.\n    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are\nuncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared\nto cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,\nCCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.\n    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents\nto store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in\ngovernment storage.\n    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative\narm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the\ngovernment more to use certificates instead of cash in farm\nprice and income support programs, Reagan administration\nsources said.\n    The GAO is expected to point out that use of\npayment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight\nstorage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been\nsold.\n    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director\nBrian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees\nintensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal\nbudget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of\nPIK certificates.\n    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or\ncerts, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to\nfarmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to\nrepay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or\ncash.\n    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion\ndlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another\n6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and\nAugust 1987, according to USDA.\n    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily\nbecause recipients can use the certificates to pay back\ngovernment loans at levels below the loan rate.\n    Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save\nthe government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to\nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according\nto a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates\ncost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.\n    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be\nconsidering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other\nsavings alternatives.\n    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the\nestimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date\nhave cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln\ndlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one\nadministration official said.\n    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates\nbased in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.\n    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable\nto the different effect certificates can have on market prices\nover the course of a crop year.\n    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found\nthat between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of\ncorn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by\nbetween 35 and 45 cents per bushel.\n    Between September and November, however, certificates had\nonly a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS\nstudy, obtained by Reuters.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It would however be able to make\neconomic, trade and finance agreements with other countries.\n    The head of government would be named on the basis of\nelections held for the post.\n    Macao would have an elected legislative assembly and an\nindependent judiciary. There would be religious freedom, a free\npress and freedom of expression. The Portuguese language could\ncontinue to be used in the government, assembly and courts.\n    Cavaco Silva said the current financial system would\ncontinue after the year 2000. The existing banks and freedom of\ncapital movements would be maintained as would the\nconvertibility of the pataca as the territory's monetary unit\nand the legal protection of foreign investment.\n    Only the Macao government would be able to collect taxes.\n    Cavaco Silva said that those among Macao's 400,000\npopulation who held Portuguese nationality on the date of the\nhandover would thereafter continue to be able to use their\nPortuguese passports and their nationality rights.\n    The nationality issue had been one of the points of\ndisagreement in the complex handover talks.\n    The special administrative status to be granted to Macao\nafter its handover mirrors a similar accord for the nearby\nBritish colony of Hong Kong, which reverts back to Chinese rule\nin 1997 under a 1984 Sino-British agreement.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Canada declined to state a position.\n    Behind the dispute was a U.S. attempt to radically change\nthe direction of the Bank, which has lent 35 billion dlrs to\nLatin America in its 28 years, and give it a bigger role in the\ncurrent debt strategy with increased lending but more stringent\nconditions attached.\n    But Ortiz said the Bank cannot divert too much of its\nresources to so-called sectoral lending, whereby loans to\nspecific sectors are tied to economic reforms, because this\ncould affect the Bank's Triple A rating as a borrower in world\nmarkets.\n    \"For this reason we have agreed to limit sectoral loans to\n25 pct of the total, leaving the rest for investment in\nprojects,\" he said.\n    Ortiz Mena earlier told the Bank's closing session that as\na result of negotiations here, the Bank can expect a new\ninjection of about 25 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90.\n    The United States has said it will only be able to support\na level close to the sixth replenishment of funds, which came\nto 15.7 billion dlrs, unless its proposals are accepted.\n    But despite the impasse, some Latin American delegates\nincluding Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said they\nwere optimistic a compromise agreement could be reached next\nmonth.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

We are exceedingly profitable,\" a\nspokesman for the firm told Reuters.\n    The rumors that have swirled around Drexel, more than any\nother broker, have involved concerns that its business will be\nthreatened by the Federal probe, say Wall Street sources. The\nfirm has long been at the leading edge of the mergers business\nand had ties to now-disgraced speculator Ivan Boesky.\n    In the latest chapter of the story, Drexel said that some\ncommodities firms have begun to limit the amount of business\nthey will do with the firm, citing credit risks. Drexel has\nlong been a powerful competitor in precious metals markets.\n    But Drexel spokesman Steve Anredder told Reuters that\nDrexel's overall business is proceeding normally and the\nfirst-quarter profit \"could be the strongest of anybody on Wall\nStreet.\"\n    \"I wouldn't say we're not feeling any effect (from the\ntrading probes),\" he said. \"But we're doing extremely well.\"\n    The firm was among the first to be subpoenaed in the\ngovernment's wide-ranging probe of illegal trading involving\nthe use of confidential company information on Wall Street.\n    Believed to be under particular scrutiny was Drexel's \"junk\nbond\" operation -- the issuance of high-risk speculative debt\nthat it pioneered for financing corporate takeovers.\n    \"We have done nothing wrong,\" said the Drexel spokesman.\n\"After a thorough investigation, we have found no evidence of\nany wrongdoing by the firm or anyone within the firm.\"\n    The spokesman said that in the aftermath of the Boesky\narrest, Drexel had not been charged. Nor had any individual at\nthe firm been charged with illegal acts while employed by\nDrexel. One of its top merger specialists, Martin Siegel, was\ncharged in connection with a former job.\n    Still, more than any other firm on Wall Street, Drexel has\nsuffered the consequences of the insider trading probe. To\nbegin with, there have been a series of brief shocks in the\njunk bond market, in nervousness linked to rumors that Drexel\nmight be in trouble.\n    At one point, Drexel said Wednesday, a large Midwest bank\nrefused to allow Drexel-issued bonds as collateral on credit\nlines. Two weeks ago, the restriction was withdrawn, it said.\n    The company also was notified last month that the outside\ninsurer of Drexel's individual brokerage accounts had decided\nnot to renew coverage. Drexel has set up its own subsidiary\nhandling part of the insurance. American International Group\nand a group of British underwriters have handled the rest.\n    Drexel also appears to have lost ground to others in the\nmergers and acquisition business recently, market sources said.\nHowever, Anredder said that there was no sign that Drexel had\nlost any customers at all owing to the insider trading cases.\nBut in citing results for the quarter, the company points\nmostly to other areas of success.\n    Corporate financings have totaled 8 billion dlrs, including\n3 billion dlrs in new junk bonds in the January-March period,\nDrexel said. Drexel maintains the lion's share of this\nlucrative business, trade sources noted.\n    The market for junk bonds, although jittery, \"has rallied\nback with a vengeance,\" Anredder said.\n    Although they see new competition in the junk bond arena,\nmarket sources concur that Drexel remains king of the hill.\n    While some of the leading Wall Street firms were limiting\nhead-to-head dealings with Drexel in the commodity markets \nbased on worries over the credit of the company, the Drexel\nspokesman called this \"ridiculous.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He said subsidising state firms' losses\ncost 32.25 billion yuan. The 1985 budget did not give a\nseparate figure for this.\n    He said the processing industry developed too fast and some\nprojects could not start operations because of power shortages,\nwhile too many non-productive facilities were set up.\n    Wang said 1986 and 1985 investment in fixed assets rose\n15.3 pct and 41.8 pct respectively year on year and consumption\nfunds rose 12.5 pct and 23.7 pct, outstripping the growth in\nnational income.\n    Wang said revenues were affected by the steep fall in world\noil prices, the decline in the price of primary products, a\ndrop in income from customs duties and the rising cost of\nearning foreign exchange through exports.\n    Revenue also fell because the state raised the rate of\ndepreciation for fixed assets of certain state firms, reduced\ntheir regulatory tax and made other tax cuts for firms.\n    Wang said 1986 tax receipts rose to 206.45 billion yuan\nfrom 201.82 billion in 1985, state treasury bond receipts to\n6.2 billion from 6.04 billion and receipts from foreign loans\nrose to 7.87 billion from 2.5 billion.\n    He said 1986 budgetary spending on capital construction\nrose to 65.57 billion yuan from 56.97 billion in 1985, on\ntechnical renovation and new products to 12.62 billion from\n10.05 billion, aid to rural production and other farm expenses\nto 12.03 billion from 10.16 billion, culture, science,\neducation and public health to 38 billion from 31.72 billion\nand defence to 20.13 billion from 19.15 billion.\n     Wang said expenditure for repaying principal and interest\non foreign loans in 1986 was 3.4 billion yuan, up from 3.26\nbillion in 1985.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The discussion is\nnow on pricing (of just the cash payments),\" he said.\n    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the\nPhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8\nover the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would\nnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.\n    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement\nmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more than\nthree weeks.\n    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8\nover LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,\ndollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially\nyield up to one point over LIBOR.\n    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at\nleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had\ngrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other\nlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.\n    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a\nseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund their\nown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the\nsecondary market, Ongpin said.\n    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full\nface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments\nat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.\n    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs\nproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of\ncertain investment banks which are already active in the\nsecondary market for sovereign debt.\n    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs\nwould include no government fees and would be free from\n\"administrative hassles.\"\n    He said about six investment banks had been approached and\nfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45\nmln dlrs worth of notes, he said.\n    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in\nthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines\ncould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign\nexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring\nperiod.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Dlrs over the next two years to encourage electronics\nfirms to send engineers for training overseas.\n    The engineers will learn design of application specific\nintegrated circuits (ASIC) used in products ranging from\npersonal computers to high-technology toys that talk.\n    The government has funded vocational training before but\nthis will be its first such program aimed at bringing back\nadvanced technology from overseas.\n    Government officials told Reuters that other areas in the\nelectronics sector are being considered for similar treatment.\n    Hong Kong's key electronics industry last year accounted\nfor exports of 61 billion H.K. Dlrs, though the total includes\nsales of electrical machinery and other items.\n    Officials said that this key sector, second only to\ntextiles in terms of exports, needs high technologies already\navailable in neighbouring economies if it is to compete.\n    \"Belatedly, we realize there are some technologies which\ncan't be taught here,\" said K.Y. Yeung, Director of Industry.\n    A study by U.S. Research firm Dataquest Inc last year\nshowed that Hong Kong's share of U.S. Consumer electronic\nimports had fallen to 3.5 pct in 1985 from 6.4 pct in 1983.\n    South Korea, Taiwan and Japan all take a more active role\nin guiding economic development and policy makers are worried\nthat perhaps some assistance -- albeit limited -- is needed.\n    \"This is perceived to be an area of development for Hong\nKong,\" said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation\nof Hong Kong Industries. \"Many industrialists think government\nshould be more actively concerned with this area.\"\n    Hong Kong likes to call its policy \"positive\nnon-intervention,\" meaning that it helps industry mainly by\nmaintaining economic stability and ensuring that needed roads\nand harbour facilities are in place.\n    It offers no special tax incentives for foreign investors,\nbelieving that its low corporate profits tax of 18 pct and\npersonal income tax of 16.5 pct are sufficient.\n    But the government has been forced to gradually take a more\nactive role in the economy. In the last three years it has\nstepped in to aid seven problem banks, taking over three of\nthem, to protect depositors whose funds were not insured.\n    It has also expanded the powers of its banking and\nsecurities commissions to police these key economic sectors.\n    Industry officials said manufacturers need help acquiring\nexpensive new technology, especially when returns on investment\nare years away. \"This is only a small start but it will help\nmake this technology more readily available,\" said an engineer\nwith a major U.S. Electronics firm in Hong Kong.\n    Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> of the\nU.S. And Japan's Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> already conduct ASIC\ndesign work in Hong Kong, while a handful of firms have\ncommitted funds for capital-intensive production.\n    Under the industry department program, companies would be\nfunded to train engineers overseas but those employees would be\nrequired to apply their new skills locally for an as yet\nunspecified period.\n    \"We want to promote ASIC design and eventually production in\nHong Kong,\" said Yeung of the Industry Department.\n    Some industrialists said it will take more than a training\nprogram to keep electronics manufacturers competitive in the\nyears ahead. Government officials said most manufacturers in\nthe industry are small scale, employing fewer than 100 people.\n    These firms will not be able to afford expensive technology\ndevelopment programs, industry officials said.\n    The program has raised concerns that government may one day\nveer too far from its policy of minimal intervention. \"They've\nreached the right decision,\" said Mills of the Federation of\nIndustries. \"But the fear (among some firms) is it might be a\nslippery slope towards interference.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "The possibility that a major earthquake\nwill strike Tokyo, causing corporate and financial ruin, haunts\nthe worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled by\nReuters.\n    The Japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremors\nevery year, but last week's biq quake in western Japan, which\nmeasured 6.9 on the open-ended Richter scale, was a timely\nreminder that the big one could come at any time.\n    Another on Tuesday registering a preliminary 6.5 on the\nscale struck the Sea of Japan coast northwest of Tokyo.\n    A widely accepted theory by the late seismologist Kawasumi\nHiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69\nyears. Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading\n7.8, raising the spectre of another within five years.\n    Seismic experts at Shizuoka, one of three areas near Tokyo\nconsidered quake-prone, say they expect a major earthquake\nwithin the next few years.\n    Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation\nhas suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in\nthe last two decades which have bound the global economy into a\ncomplex, fragile, interdependent financial network.\n    \"We are reaching a dangerous time. Insurance companies are\nstarting to worry about how to cover the large losses,\" said\nHatsuho Narita, a manager at the British Insurance Group.\n    \"It's a theme that has worried a lot of people. It's\ndifficult to put a figure on it, but the impact on all world\nmarkets would be considerable,\" Brian Waterhouse, a banking\nexpert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo, told Reuters.\n    What would happen?\n    Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures\naccount for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product, or\nsome six pct of world GNP.\n    Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of\na Tokyo quake, the yen would rise against sterling because of\nthe large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London.\nBut it would plunge against other currencies.\n    This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and\nassets in the Tokyo area. Banks would be left holding hundreds\nof billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans.\n    Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional\nbanks' loan exposure is to smaller business, which would most\nlikely lose all in a quake. Up to nine pct of their exposure is\nin housing and consumer loans, they said.\n    Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the\nwall, bankers polled by Reuters said.\n    The government, aware that insurance claims would be huge,\nhas set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house. In\nTokyo, 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence.\n    In addition, the insurance industry has formed the Japan\nEarthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10\nbillion dlrs, 80 pct of it government-guaranteed.\n    However, insurers said the industrial sector, which has no\ngovernment backing, is a more dangerous risk.\n    Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly\ndifficult to find reinsurance abroad.\n    \"Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance\nrisks,\" said Tahashi Kumakiri, Foreign Department head at the\nJapan Non-life Insurance Association.\n    Due to limited world insurance capacity, the Finance\nMinistry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of\nJapanese firms' total insurable value.\n    Even so, one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up\nto 80 pct of their quake cover overseas, most of it through\nLloyds of London.\n    Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again,\ncompounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in.\n    Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover\nbut foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct.\n    Industrial cover is confidential but official figures show\nthat in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31, Japan did about half a\nbillion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover,\nmost of which is quake-related.\n    Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and\nrepatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment\nwould seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets.\n    Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of\nforeign bonds a month, much of it U.S. Treasuries, and are\npurchasing more and more U.S. And European stocks. The value of\nforeign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive.\n    Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period\nto rebuild, which would block out developing nation creditors\nfrom existing capital resources, the bankers said.\n    Loss of central computers would mean billions in lost\ntransactions, bankers noted.\n    Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell\nby up to half from some three mln barrels per day now.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Funds\nmust go into energy, transport, telecommunications, raw and\nsemi-finished materials and not into non-production sectors.\n    \"In view of the country's financial difficulties this year,\nit has been decided that seven billion yuan of the budgetary\nallocation for capital construction will be raised by the\nPeople's Bank through loans and the issuing of bonds,\" he said.\n    Wang said all localities and departments must strictly\nconfine their 1987 capital investment to the amount set out in\nthe state budget, a 50 pct reduction from 1986 levels.\n    He said that because of financial difficulties, the state\ncannot increase spending on culture, education, science and\npublic health in 1987 at the same rate as over the past few\nyears. Expenditure in those sectors will rise by two pct.\n    The only allocations not to be affected by the general 10\npct cutback are subsidies for price rises, repayment of\nprincipal and interest on domestic and foreign loans, funds for\nthe disabled and spending for other social relief.\n    Wang said state firms must cut their total losses by 30 pct\nfrom the 1986 level, overhead expenses by 10 pct and raw\nmaterial consumption by two pct. Commercial firms must cut\ntheir deficits by 20 pct and running costs by two pct.\n    He said violations of financial and economic discipline are\ncommon, including tax evasion, false accounting, embezzlement,\ntheft, extravagance and accepting and offering bribes. Such\npractices \"have reached very serious proportions in some areas,\ndepartments and units\" and must be dealt with seriously, he\nsaid.\n    Wang said 11.4 billion yuan worth of foreign loans have\nbeen arranged according to the 1986-90 plan, with 3.2 billion\ngoing to pay for foreign equipment in the Baoshan steel plant\nnear Shanghai.\n    He said China is running no risk in using more foreign\nloans, provided it prepares careful feasibility studies,\nborrows only what it can repay and uses the loans only to\ndevelop production in priority sectors.\n    Wang said China plans to levy new taxes on the use of\narable land for non-farm purposes starting this year. Half the\nrevenue generated will go to the state and half to localities\nto be used in the development of agriculture.\n    The only new spending is 11 billion yuan to be used to\ncover tax reductions and increased subsidies for big and\nmedium-size state firms and textile and other light industries.\nThe money will also pay for increases in the state purchasing\nprices of some grain, cotton and oil-yielding crops, he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it\nintended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil\nCo &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for\na total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.\n    The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>\nunit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The\noffer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares\nbeing tendered.\n    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based\non its own valuation as well as those of its financial\nadvisers. It took into account reviews of both public and\nnon-public information.\n    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down\n1-3/4 dlrs.\n    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at\nlast night's close.\n    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's\nown resources.\n    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from\nbanks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and\npartly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The\ncompany said it was in the course of arranging these\nfacilities.\n    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's\ninvestment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full\nownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be\nmade without the limitations of a minority interest.\n    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum\nuse of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices\nwere likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the\ninvestment.\n    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management\nchanges in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even\nin a lower oil price environment.\n    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs\nand in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before\ntax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.\n    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.\nOne noted that it was not immediately clear why the group\nshould spend so much money buying a company it already\ncontrolled.\n    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard\nshares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.\n    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on\nthe U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to\ndispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the\n1987/88 financial year, analysts said.\n    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted\nthat any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would\ndepend on the reaction of the markets.\n    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59\npct from 20 pct currently, he said.\n    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not\nrepeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard\nreturning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from\nits cash flow -- were good.\n    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.\n    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to\nmake money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from\nproduction and its downstream activities would push it\ncomfortably into surplus.\n    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the\ndiscovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had\ninadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,\nwhich was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude\noil.\n    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management\nreorganisation of Standard in the past year.\n    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was\nnow complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the\ntender offer, Spedding said.\n    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major\nbalance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well\nreceived in the markets.\n    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially\nafter the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division\n-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come\nstraight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by\nother sectors.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a\nstatement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a\nfall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.\n    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and\nother currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure\non selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of\ncrude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of\npolystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.\n    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in\n1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01\nbillion from 42.72 billion.\n    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion\nmarks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.\n    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.\nHoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.\n    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the\ncold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues\nat present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the\nprevious year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from\n1986, Hoechst said.\n    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information\ntechnology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.\n    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of\nthe parent company, other units in West Germany, and to\n&lt;American Hoechst Corp>.\n    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the\nrestructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.\n    Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated\npartners did not perform as well as in 1985.\n    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax\nprofits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings\nfrom interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in\nextraordinary costs.\n    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to\ncompensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and\ncurrencies, Hoechst said.\n    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new\nprojects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital\nincrease of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the\nacquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.\n    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to\nform &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp>.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But the current\naccount surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus\nrecorded in February 1986.\n    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the\nFebruary current account surplus compared with January was due\nto seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account\nfigures are seasonally adjusted.\n    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled\n32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986\nbut a rise of 5.5 pct against January.\n    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56\nbillion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct\ncompared with January.\n    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate\nthe real change in exports and imports in February. But for\ncomparison purposes it noted that in January the average value\nof imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average\nvalue of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.\n    Within the current account, the services account had 300\nmln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark\nsurplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark\ndeficit.\n    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in\nvalue terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a\nyear earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,\na decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.\n    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for\nJanuary/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1\nbillion marks in the year-ago period.\n    The cumulative current account surplus for January and\nFebruary 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion\nmarks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.\n    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus\nreflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as\nseasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier\nthis week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against\nJanuary while export prices were unchanged.\n    \"The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend\nthat is not expected to change for several months at least,\"\nsaid an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987\nas a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record\n112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the\nsurplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.\n    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in\nFrankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a\nmore accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.\n    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and\nFebruary together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus\nposted in November and December.\n    \"The trend is clearly lower,\" he said.\n    This economist, who declined to be named, said the February\nrise was also partly explained by special factors in January,\nwhen there had been a number of public holidays as well as\nextremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Is too marginal,\" a\nHousewives Association of Japan official said.\n    Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm\nmarkets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which\nmaintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.\n    Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the\nstandard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled\nbeef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against\n1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.\n    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from\ndairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling\nat 1,325 against 1,420.\n    Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock\nIndustry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations\nto help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention\nprice zone.\n    The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount\nset by the government under a quota system. When wholesale\nprices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,\nboth domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when\nprices are below.\n    But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef\nstocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.\n    Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export\nFederation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step\ntoward closing the gap with European Community prices, about\nhalf those in Japan.\n    But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.\nMeat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated\ndistribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.\n    The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices\nare high mainly because of distribution problems and high\nproduction costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.\n    American meat packers see Japan as a promising market.

He said bidding would be either\nopen-priced, if there were enough serious contenders, or the\nAPT would set a target price for acquisition. He added that the\ntarget price did not constitute a rigid floor.\n    \"What we consider an acceptable price is a price at which an\ninvestor will earn an adequate return,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the bulk of the APT's current work relates to\nthe non-performing assets of the state-owned Development Bank\nof the Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank\n(PNB). The APT was set up in January.\n    SyCip said about 75 pct of the 400-odd assets that the DBP\nand the PNB are handing over to the APT are still in the form\nof financial assets.\n    \"In some cases financial assets have been converted into\nphysical assets by foreclosures. They are fairly cut and dried\nbecause we are dealing with mostly whole production facilities\nlike textile or food-processing plants,\" he said.\n    \"Financial assets are more complicated. The only recourse is\nto foreclose, gain titles, and try to sell the asset, but the\nlaws here tend to favour the debtors,\" he added.\n    SyCip said although the APT is protected from prosecution\nby its charter, many debtors are tying up the panel with\nlitigation.\n    \"If you see some of the situations we have to work our way\nthrough you will see that our symbol, a Gordian knot, is an apt\nillustration,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the PNB has not succeeded in foreclosing on 16\nof the 17 sugar factories it wants to sell because of the high\ncosts involved. \"When you do your arithmetic you realise that if\nyou did foreclose your recovery would be only a fraction of the\nasset's book exposure,\" he said.\n    SyCip said the APT was not worried about whether associates\nof former President Ferdinand Marcos, who originally owned many\nof the bankrupt companies, would buy them back through the\nprivatisation scheme.\n    \"We just look at the bottom line, which is to monetise these\nassets to the maximum degree possible,\" he said. \"We are selling\nfor cash, it is not our concern where it comes from.\"\n    He said he had told cabinet ministers sceptical about the\nidentities of buyers that \"Marcos cronies\" could easily put up\nlegitimate fronts if they were specifically barred from bidding\nfor assets on the block.\n    \"I told them if I am paid 20 mln pesos in 100-peso bills,\nall with identical serial numbers and they look like genuine\nlegal currency, then I would accept them',\" SyCip said.\n    He said some participants in the government's debt-equity\nswap scheme were interested in buying non-performing assets\nwith the pesos they receive from such deals. The problem is\ngovernment regulations slow down approval of debt-equity plans\nand the APT normally demands full payment within 15 days.\n    \"The Central Bank and Monetary Board could also look at\ninvestment funds earmarked for non-performing asset purchases,\"\nhe said. \"It would greatly facilitate matters.\"\n    SyCip said last month the APT hoped to recover about 24\nbillion pesos of the assets' total worth of 108 billion.\n    President Corazon Aquino announced earlier this month that\nproceeds from the sale of APT-controlled assets would be used\nto finance the government's land reform program, which aims to\ndistribute about 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants.\n    Asked why the APT did not favour Filipino buyers, SyCip\nsaid: \"How much money has the country to lose because of this\n'Filipinos first' slogan? How many people have become\nmillionaires and then forgotten the Philippines and put their\nmoney in the United States or Australia?\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The rest will be used up when\nbonds are issued to absorb advance deposits of 13.9 billion\ndlrs from the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a mandatory pension\nsavings scheme. Workers and employers contribute a respective\n25 pct and 10 pct of a worker's salary to the CPF, which had\nfunds totalling 29.3 billion at end-1986.\n    Regular government securities issues are needed to meet the\ndemand of banks, insurance companies, other financial\ninstitutions and corporate and individual investors, Hu said.\n    The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had said it\nplanned to launch trading by issuing taxable instruments\ngrossing seven billion dlrs in the first year and a gross 38\nbillion dlrs of paper over the next five years.\n    Funds raised in excess of the government's budgetary needs\nwill not be channelled into increased spending, but will be\nrecycled back to the financial system, largely through the MAS,\nHu said.\n    Hu said the current government securities market is\nrudimentary, with the CPF holding three-quarters of the\noutstanding debt and banks, discount houses and insurance\ncompanies holding the rest. \"The concentration of securities in\nthe hands of such long-term holders has left little scope for\ntrading activity,\" he said.\n    \"Moreover, the maturity of the bonds, mostly 20 years, was\nnot attractive to other investors who might have been expected\nto deal more actively in the market. The infrequency of bond\nissues exacerbated the lack of liquidity necessary for the\ndevelopment of a market,\" Hu said.\n    Hu said these obstacles have been resolved and regular\nissues of government securities will be made, initially\ncarrying terms of up to five years and market-related yields.\n    The minimum denomination is 1,000 dlrs for notes and bonds\n-- aimed at individual investors -- and 10,000 dlrs for the\ntreasury bills, which are directed at corporate investors.\n    Eight primary and registered dealers have undertaken to\nmake markets in order to ensure liquidity, he said.\n    Hu said while the new government securities market will be\nessentially domestic, non-residents are free to invest, but\ninterest earned will be subject to withholding tax.\n    Hu said under the new Treasury Bills (Amendment) Bill, all\nbook entries of borrowings through treasury bill issues must be\nmade in records maintained by MAS.\n    Hu said that instead of physical certificates having to\ntravel back and forth at each transaction, with side trips to\nthe MAS for registration, the MAS will maintain a computerised\nsystem for updating records in a central register.\n    Commercial banks and primary and registered government\nsecurities dealers will each have two securities accounts with\nthe MAS, one for their own holdings and the other for holdings\non behalf of all their customers, Hu said.\n    All trades will be reflected daily in changes in these\naccounts, Hu said.\n    \"These institutions will in turn act as custodians of\ngovernment securities for their customers, rendering each an\nindividual accounting of his holdings.\"\n    Hu said the new system will cut storage and handling costs\nand paper work, reduce the danger of loss, theft, destruction\nand counterfeiting, and permit greater speed and efficiency in\nhandling large volumes of transactions.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The rise was mainly due\nto payment in January for a West German nuclear power station\nwhich led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.\n    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a\nthree pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.\n    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8\nbillion marks against the same 1985/86 period.\n    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between\none and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.\n    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the\ncommunications and telecommunications sectors in particular\nshould contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.\n    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for\n1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the\ndollar, Kaske said.\n    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group\nnet profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the\nsame period in the previous year.\n    Turnover in the first five months rose particularly\nstrongly in the installations and automotive technology,\ncommunications and telecommunications sectors, but components\nand energy and automation showed a sharp decline.\n    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in\nthe first five months of this year, or nine pct above their\nlevel in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by\norders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.\n    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An\nincrease in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad\nwas balanced by the decline in the dollar.\n    While the installations and automotive technology sector\nshowed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and\ncommunications orders were below the level achieved in the same\nperiod of 1985/86.\n    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same\nlevel.\n    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six\nbillion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous\nyear.

Price alone was not the only factor in\ninternational competitiveness, he said, adding German firms\nhave a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery\ntimes and good service.\n    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult\nposition on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure\nto reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried\nabout the effect of the mark's strength on the country's\nexporters.\n    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,\ntended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a\nrecord 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was\ndue entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the\ndecline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have\nin fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "The monetary authorities of the major\nindustrialised countries lost their credibility this week as\nthe dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and\nwidespread central bank intervention, dealers said.\n    The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's\nParis currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West\nGermany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of\nthe success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza\nmeeting to weaken the dollar, they said.\n    The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was\novervalued but this time the market and the authorities are on\ndifferent sides, dealers said.\n    Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has\nencouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite\nconcerted intervention by the central banks of the United\nStates, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.\n    Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for\naction to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by\ncomments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was\nno target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.\n    Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris\naccord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.\n    The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul\nVolcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,\nwhich a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a\nhalt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they\nnoted.\n    The situation has again raised the question of whether\nintervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge\ncurrency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to\nintervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.\n    \"This means that the current dollar selling is not of a\nsheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,\" said Koichi\nMiyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.\n    Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the\nintervention and it is only a matter of time before some\noperators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in\nTokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record\nlow was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.\n    Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to\nrise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven\nindustrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.\n    The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus\nItaly) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies\napart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.\n    Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be\nused and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris\naccord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to\nprevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.\nTrade deficit, especially with Japan.\n    Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a\nlower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.\n    The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow\nthe dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said\nTadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.\n    Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large\nforward dollar sales from April to June for export bills\nfalling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.\n    The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen\ndepreciation, dealers said.\n    Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks\nineffective in light of this real demand, they said.\n    The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar\nsales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new\nbusiness year starting April 1, dealers said.\n    \"The market seems to have established a new dollar trading\nrange between 147 and 149 yen,\" one dealer said.\n    The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris\naccord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low\nend for the dollar against the yen, he said.\n    Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148\nyen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to\n145.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Swiss lawyers have largely headed off an\nattempt to restrict banking secrecy and curb their powers to\nact for clients despite the new, revised code of banking\nconduct agreed by the Bankers' Association this week, analysts\nsaid.\n    The \"laundering\" of drug and \"insider dealing\" money and\ncontroversy over accounts of the ousted Philippine and Haitian\nPresidents have hurt the standing of Swiss banks recently and\nstrained international relations, particularly with the United\nStates.\n    Critics said the new code fell well short of demands for\nreform, doing little to close a key loophole in the requirement\nthat banks know the identity of their customers.\n    The Social Democratic party, a member of the ruling\nfour-party coalition, which forced an unsuccesful 1984\nreferendum to curb banking secrecy, complained the code still\nfell short of the legal controls they wanted.\n    \"It looks a slight improvement on paper, but the same tricks\nwill still be possible in practice,\" Felix Meier, a senior party\nofficial, told Reuters.\n    In contrast, Swiss lawyers are happy with the new code.\n    \"Apart from a few nuances, we are very pleased with the\nagreement,\" said Max Oesch, a senior official of the Swiss\nLawyers Federation, which has fought a long campaign to prevent\nany curbs on lawyers' ability to act for their clients.\n    \"It has shown that the 4,000 Swiss lawyers who do a good job\nshould not be punished for the sake of getting at the one or\ntwo black sheep.\"\n    The role of lawyers has been at the centre of long running\ndiscussions on the renewal of the so-called \"convention of\ndiligence,\" a voluntary code of banking conduct introduced in\nresponse to a major banking scandal here in 1977.\n    With secrecy back in the public eye due to the Ferdinand\nMarcos case and a Swiss bank link to the recently busted \"Pizza\nConnection\" international heroin ring, officials at the Banking\nCommission said earlier this year they wanted a tightening of\nrules on anonymity.\n    However, the changes in the new code, which comes into\noperation in October, have been minor.\n    Clients will still be able to keep their identity secret\nfrom the banks provided their lawyer pledges that the\nrelationship with his client \"is not only of a temporary nature\"\nand involves provision of other legal services.\n    The Lawyers' Association said this part of their business\nis very minimal anyway. In the majority of cases, people had\nperfectly legal private or commercial reasons for not wanting\nthe bank to know their identity, Oesch said.\n    The Banking Commission, despite its earlier demand for a\nvirtual abolition of the loophole, also said it was happy with\nthe new code.\n    However, critics complain that the agreement does not go\nfar enough to restrict the role of lawyers and could still be\ncircumvented by criminals.\n    \"No other group in society is allowed to regulate itself as\nmuch as the banks,\" complained Meier of the Social Democrats. \"I\nhope that the Banking Commission exercises its proper control\nfunction.\"\n    However, other parts of the agreement won praise.\n    In particular, banks will also now be required to demand\nthe identity anyone doing more than 100,000 Swiss francs worth\nof business with them, even if they do not have an account at\nthe bank. Until now, the threshold was 500,000 francs.\n    Peter Kluser, head of the National Bank's legal department,\nwhich had argued for a lower limit, said the move could help\ncombat the use of banks to \"launder\" or hide the criminal origin\nof money.\n    The new code also clarifies the legal status of a tribunal\nable to impose heavy fines on banks which do not respect the\ncode.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The one mln tonne upward revision in\n1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.\nThe IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to\n87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.\n    The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and\ncoarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln\nagainst 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln\nrise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.\n    The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is\nlikely to be down from last year as low world prices and\nrestrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.\n    At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a\ndrop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There\nis still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the\nIWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.\n    Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain\noutlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the\nEuropean Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is\nexpected lower but oat sowings could rise.\n    After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union\nplans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln\nhectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are\nlikely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved\nweather and a further increase in the use of intensive\ncultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet\nmaize output in 1987, the IWC said.\n    Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be\nbolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC\nsaid.\n    It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at\nend&#127;of different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln\ntonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.\n    After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln\ntonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of\nanother large crop this coming season with higher output\nexpected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February\nto 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove\npartly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer\nexpenditure on imported goods.\n    However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his\nfirm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than\nthe European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    LONDON, March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15\nmln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying\nbank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct.\n    Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity\nforecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln\nstg.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

At some time during that period all the\nproducers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\n    These changes did not always result in lower export\nsubsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\nthan offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\n    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\nprice for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\ncurrency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\nmost export transactions are denominated, the intervention\nprice however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\nsupporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\nand some governments are now searching for ways to cut\nexpenditure, the report says.\n    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\nmajor exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\nfrom 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\nincreased production in China and India.\n    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\ncountered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\nacreages.\n    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\ncent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\nother enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\nAcreages are attributed to official incentives.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The discussion is\nnow on pricing (of just the cash payments),\" he said.\n    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the\nPhilippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8\nover the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would\nnot discuss details of the pricing negotiations.\n    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement\nmight be reached. The talks have been going on for more than\nthree weeks.\n    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8\nover LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,\ndollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially\nyield up to one point over LIBOR.\n    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at\nleast a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had\ngrave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other\nlarge debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.\n    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a\nseparate option for those banks, which might want to fund their\nown investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the\nsecondary market, Ongpin said.\n    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full\nface value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments\nat any time prior to their six-year maturity date.\n    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs\nproposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of\ncertain investment banks which are already active in the\nsecondary market for sovereign debt.\n    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs\nwould include no government fees and would be free from\n\"administrative hassles.\"\n    He said about six investment banks had been approached and\nfour had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45\nmln dlrs worth of notes, he said.\n    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in\nthe secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines\ncould conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign\nexchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring\nperiod.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "British banks are resisting signing a 76\nbillion dlr rescheduling package for Mexico in a last ditch\neffort to get all participants to contribute equally to a new\n7.7 billion dlr loan contained in the package.\n    Christopher Brougham, regional manager, rescheduling unit,\nat Lloyds Bank Plc, said in response to a Reuter enquiry, that\nthe six major U.K. Clearing banks last week sent a telex to\nCitibank saying they would contribute what was requested\nprovided all other major lenders did the same and that the U.S.\nBanks contribute at least 90 pct of the amount required by\nthem.\n    Other bankers, who declined to be identified, said other\ngroups of banks particularly those in Switzerland, France and\nCanada, were equally reluctant to sign, although they had not\nsent any telex to Citibank, which chairs Mexico's 13-bank\nadvisory group.\n    However, they said it was likely that if and when the\nBritish banks sign the accord, the others are likely to follow.\n    Under the agreement, for which the signing began on Friday,\ncommercial banks are being asked to contribute 12.9 pct of\ntheir exposure to Mexico as of August 1982. That was the date\nof the first Mexican debt crisis.\n    After months of haggling, a proposed rescheduling agreement\nfor Mexico was struck last September during the annual meeting\nof the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in\nWashington.\n    Ever since then the advisory group, of which Lloyds is a\nmember, has been attempting to round up the needed signatories.\n    However, there has been considerable resistance to the\npackage, partly because of some of the clauses it contains and\npartly because many small U.S. Regional banks do not want to\nincrease their exposure to any Latin American countries.\n    Brougham said, \"We (British banks) have always played along\nfor Mexico and will do so as long as others share equally.\"\n    The decision to send the telexes was agreed on by the six\nclearers jointly, but each sent its own telex.\n    In addition to Lloyds, telexes were sent by National\nWestminster Bank Plc, Barclays Bank Plc, Midland Bank Plc,\n&#127;tandard Chartered Bank Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.\n    Brougham noted that so far the U.S. Banks have only reached\n83-1/2 pct of the total that is expected from them, while the\nlevel of contributions from the U.K. Banks is well in excess of\n90 pct. \"The U.S. Figure should be closer to ours,\" he said.\n    Many bankers have been angered by the resistance of the\nregional U.S. Banks, noting that even if they don't contribute\nto the new loan they still will be receiving interest on the\nexisting loans.\n    The banks still have three weeks to sign the agreement and\nbankers are hoping all will go according to plan.\n    In the meantime, bankers expect further pressure will be\nexercised on the regional banks and the major U.S. Banks to\nfind a solution to the problem. Many have suggested that the\nlarger U.S. Banks should take on the additional obligations,\nbut so far they have resisted this.\n    Bankers expect that much of the pressure on the U.S. Banks\nwill come from U.S. Regulators, notably the Federal Reserve.\n    Bankers prefer to view the stance taken by the British\nbanks and other national groups as \"a matter of principal, and\nburden sharing\" rather than as a \"pressure tactic\" to force the\nU.S. Banks to make up their share.\n    The bankers are not the only ones to be upset by the\nprotracted negotiations surrounding the agreement.\n    The Mexicans themselves have been angered by the delays. At\nthe signing in New York last Friday, Finance Minister Gustavo\nPetricioli sounded a warning to the recalcitrant banks.\n    \"Those who supported us today can be sure that Mexico will\ncontinue to be open and willing to share with them the business\nopportunities which its future growth will create,\" Petricioli\nsaid.\n    Conversion of bank debt into equity investments in Mexico\nis one option banks can take advantage of to reduce their\nexposure. But Mexico halted its debt for equity program in\nFebruary in an effort to concentrate on finalising the package.\n    On Friday, Petricioli said \"We will be a lot more\nexpeditious in processing the requests of banks that have\nsupported us.\"\n    The pressure on the U.S. Banks comes at a time when other\nmajor Latin American debtors are in the process of crucial debt\nnegotiations.\n    Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, has suspended all\ninterest payments on its 109 billion dlrs of foreign debt. Many\nof the major U.S. Banks, including Citibank, have already said\nthey might have to put their Brazil loans on a cash basis and\ntake the financial losses, which could total billions of\ndollars.\n    This would be required by U.S. Banking regulations if the\ninterest payments are more than 90 days overdue.\n    However, the U.S. Banks are not the only ones threatened by\nregulations. In the U.K., A proposed Inland Revenue ruling\nwould affect the tax treatment of certain types of loans, many\nof which are made to Latin American countries.\n    Basically, the ruling wants to limit the tax credit a bank\ncan claim for tax withheld by foreign governments on loan\ninterest payments.\n    The British banks are planning to fight the proposals as\ntheir implementation could prove extremely costly, not just in\nterms of compliance but in limiting future business.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Money market sources said the market had begun\nto doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates\nto 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.\n    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.\n    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account\ndeficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.\n    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in\nFebruary to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.\n    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.\n    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and\nDrew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would\nprove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the\nChancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture\non imported goods.\n    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said\nhis firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit\nforecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion\nstg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.\n    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods\nconfirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the\nConfederation of British Industry.\n    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if\nJanuary's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas\ngoods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,\nHarwood said.\n    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2\npoint on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries\nabout the figures evaporated.\n    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling\nto a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher\nthan the European low of 1.5960.\n    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market\nsentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.\n    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was\nlargely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the\nConservative government's support was slipping.\n    The Marplan poll, published in \"Today,\" showed Conservative\nsupport had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the\nAlliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31\npct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,\nwhose own support fell from 38 pct.\n    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted\nenthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left\nthe voters indifferent, political observers said.\n    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn\nthat today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for\nPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.\n    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which\nare all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming\ngeneral election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,\nHarwood said. \"The news did come as a very, very substantial\nrelief,\" he said.\n    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution\nthat Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by\nencouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had\nalready got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in\nresponse to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for\nlower rates have been curtailed.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This made it world\nmarket leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.\n    Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold\nEagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in\nEurope and about eight pct in Asia.\n    She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion\ncoins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve\nthe Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.\n    The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,\nas long as this is available at market prices. The remaining\ngold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the\nopen market, Pope said.\n    Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here\nfrom the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from\nthe South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's\nWest German market share at 60 pct.\n    The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy\ngold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct\nvalue-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce\ncoins traded today at 906 marks, they said.\n    Competition may also come from new gold coins, including\nBelgium's ECU, which began sales today.

This\nprinciple has become a dividing, and therefore a weakening,\nfactor for the market,\" Balladur said.\n    He said under the planned new rules, stock brokers,\ncurrently very specialised and undercapitalised, would be free\nto link up with powerful financial institutions after a\nfive-year transition period.\n    Stock brokerages would be subject to legislation similar to\nthat in the U.K. And U.S., He said, adding the Paris market\nwould actively attempt to attract foreign securities houses.\n    Balladur said the French securities market had enjoyed\nstrong growth in the past 10 years, with new share and bond\nissues totalling 430 billion French francs in 1986, compared\nwith 53 billion in 1976.\n    New share issues alone totalled 63 billion francs in 1986,\nup 230 pct from the 1985 level of 19 billion francs, he said.\n    Total market capitalisation stood at 3,200 billion francs\nat end-1986, compared with 400 billion 10 years earlier, while\nstock and bond trades were valued at 2,200 billion francs last\nyear against 56 billion in 1976, he said.\n    Balladur, who also had private talks with U.K. Prime\nMinister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer\nNigel Lawson, said his government was also preparing a bill to\nliberalise the French insurance sector.\n    Under the proposed rules, an independent regulatory\ninsurance commission will be set up. The commission will be\nendowed with powers similar to those of a body set up earlier\nto monitor the banking sector, Balladur said.\n    He said the new bill would also aim to adapt insurance\nregulation to take account of the ever-closer integration of\nall areas of finance.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.\n    The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company\nfor the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill\n(the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the\nlevy contained significant currency distortions and involved\ngrain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the company\nis not being made public.\n    The Administration Court is not expected to make a final\nruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman\nsaid it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal\nCourt in Luxembourg, and \"as a result it could easily be another\nnine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.\"\n    Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are\nputting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch\ngovernment to follow through on earlier statements and seek a\ncomplete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is\ncollected, the spokesman said.\n    Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of\nEuropean animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions\nprotesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The Bundesbank's options for West\nGermany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future\nby the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and\nemployers, economists and money market dealers said.\n    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to\n3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct\ntreasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.\n    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely\nto encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for\nfear of upsetting the current wage round.\n    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, \"I\ndon't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever\nhappens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it\nwants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.\"\n    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground\nfor triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments\nof growth and inflation, economists said.\n    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the\nBundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,\nraising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the\nmedium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.\n    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move\nthat would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.\n    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,\nthe IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is\ndemanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the\npresent 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.\n    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is\noffering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give\na two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this\nyear and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.\n    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest\nunion, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the\nbenchmark for settlements in other industries such as the\npublic sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations\nbegan in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by\nearly April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.\n    Though many economists said the unions' current warning\nstrikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and\nwould not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week\nstrikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on\ntheir positions and there could still be conflict.\n    This could extend the length of time in which the\nBundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.\n    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the\nprotracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative\nhousing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.\n    \"The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this\nsquarely onto the account in the negotiations,\" he said.\n    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall\nunion, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than\nhis predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle\nto achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.\n    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in\nsouth Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours\nyesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and\naerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.\n    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in\nwarning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.\n    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates\nwould rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on\na politically-inhibited Bundesbank.\n    About eight billion marks were coming into the market\ntomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.\n    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer\nto mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,\nanticipating still lower rates before the month-end.\n    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers\nwas due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of\nliquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,\nperhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.\n    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average\n52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first\n24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He\ndeclined to give details of the statement, but said Central\nBank president Francisco Gros was seeking a 60-day extension of\nshort-term credit lines from its commercial bank creditors.\n    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dlrs,\nand deadline for payment is set for March 31.\n    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a television\ninterview that it was \"absolutely important\" for Brazil and its\ncreditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as Brazil must\nfinance its exports.\n    \"If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties\nto honour our foreign debt in the future,\" Funaro said.\n    \"There is evidently a common interest in the matter,\" he\nsaid.\n    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand\nBrazil's position and do not wish to make the negotiation for\nthe renewal of the credit lines more difficult.\n    Funaro explained that Brazil's suggestion is part of its\ndemands \"before the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the\nworld.\"\n    He said that the current negotiating process is \"very\ncomplex and complicated,\" mentioning cases of countries which\nhad to wait some 10 months before getting a reply from\ncreditors.\n    \"We are not interested in confrontation, but we would like\nthe loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both\nsides,\" Funaro said.\n    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation\nto President Jose Sarney.\n    \"Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the\npresident. Everything else is nothing but speculation,\" he said.\n    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68-\nbillion dlrs of debt to commercial banks and froze short-term\ntrade and money market lines.\n REUTER\n&#3;",
