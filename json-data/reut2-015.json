S. makers are Cetus Corp\n&lt;CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp\n&lt;IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.\n    The journal, to be released late today, contains two\narticles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.\n    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding\nthat the new results mark a significant milestone in the search\nfor a successful immunotherapy for cancer.\n    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally\nproduced by living cells in the laboratory.\n    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as\na promising cancer treatment in early reports on its\neffectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year\nlater for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its\nravaging side effects.\n    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of\nBiotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly\nsignificant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after\nit changed the way in which the drug is administered.\n    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer\npatients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers\nand a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin\ncancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart\nWeisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.\n    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no\nremissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side\neffects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital\ncare, according to the article.\n    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven\nRosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers\nadministered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct\nremission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in\nmelanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.\n    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four\npatients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness\nof the drug's side effects as originally administered.\n    \"Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search\nfor successful immunotherapy for cancer,\" said the editorial,\nsigned by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.\n    \"These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely\ndid not describe successful practical approaches ready for\nwidespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients,\" the\neditorial said.\n    \"On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a\nsuccessful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we\nmay be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in\nthe immunuotherapy of cancer,\" the editorial concluded.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will\nbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.\n    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at\n9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated\npreviously.\n    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln\ntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and\n21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln\ntonnes.\n    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to\nseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.\n    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in\nCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and\nBuenos Aires in mid-April.\n    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3\nto 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.\n    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln\ntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,\nand is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2\nmln tonne crop.\n    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,\nremaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5\npct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for\n1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of\n7.1 mln.\n    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln\nto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln\nsown in 1985/86.\n    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some\nareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some\nexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas\nmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details on\nthis were not available.\n    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which\nwill be sown between May and August or September, has so far\nnot been as intense as in previous years.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\nthe old ones.\"\n    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\nautomobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\npaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\n    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\n90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\nproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\nmanaging director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\nfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\nby as much as 300 pct, he said.\n    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\nHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\nlast year and predicted it would have the best year in its\nhistory.\n    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\nand chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\ndollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \"I believe the entire\nchemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\"\nOreffice said.\n    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\nindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\nLast year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\ndlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\n    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\nindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\nplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.\n    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\ndramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\nwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\nU.S. chemical exports.\n    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\nbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\nmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\nin the early 1980s.\n    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\nhave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\nto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\nunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\nfriendly and hostile takeover attempts.\n    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\nUnion Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\nfor Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\nand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \nhas divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\nbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\n    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\nheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\nthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\nethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\nare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\n    \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\npast two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\nchemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\ndeteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\nkill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\nmarket.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\n    \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\ncarried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF's Heyman\ncautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\nill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\"\n    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\nSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\nmln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\n    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\nof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\nbillion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\nalong the Texas Gulf Coast.\n    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\nare the building blocks of specialty products.\n    \"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\nglamorous, high-margin business,\" Cain said, adding that demand\nis expected to grow by about three pct annually.\n    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\nchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\nplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\nand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\nbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided the\nU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Foreign\nexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and\ntrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.\n    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and\ncommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net\ninvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.\n    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first\nquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell\nto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.\n    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means\nthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments are\nactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9\nmln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume\npayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.\n    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for\ncredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared\nwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.\n    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after\ncharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49\nmln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.\n    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were\n583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year\nearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from\n303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to\npersonnel costs, Morgan said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do\nSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were\nresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.\n    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West\ngrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage\ncapacity.\n    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and\nmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains\nproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.\n    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,\nthere is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to\nstoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for\nstoring loose grain, Brito said.\n    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the\ncrops.\n    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop\nhas been evident from television reports, which have shown\nenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The largest U.S. textile maker focused\non its own business as its competitors found merger partners,\nbut now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself\ninto an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.\n    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose\n4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and\nDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct\nstake.\n    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly\nacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover\noffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for\nMontreal-based Dominion called the report just \"rumors.\"\n    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.\n    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of\nthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if\nBurlington actually came into play.\n    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,\nadded credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it\nwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.\n    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills\nand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for\na U.S. acquisition.\n    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer\nhas been negotiating with \"many\" U.S. textile companies, but\nwould not say whether Burlington was among them.\n    \"There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not\nunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the\nhousecleaning they've done,\" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson\nMcKinnon.\n    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets\nand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs\nlast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its\noperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign\ncompetition, Gormley said.\n    \"They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,\"\nsaid Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial\nfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets\nand other fabric to the auto industry.\n    \"In the past, they just spent and never realized the return\non the outlays they did make,\" she said.\n    \"You look at their record over the year, and I think\nthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the\npast,\" Gormley said.\n     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up\nfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.\n    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington\nat its current levels.\n    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends\nselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50\ndlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings\nbasis.\n    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been\nplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.\n    \"After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people\ndon't find him very credible anymore,\" said one arbitrager.\n    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing\nmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if\nhe doesn't win the target company.\n    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky\nStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying\nPonderosa Inc.\n    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with\nBurlington.\n    J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest\nCannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and\nCannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4.

The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's\nmarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that\nare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western\nmoney.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

UAL last month said New York Real estate developer\nDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also\nheld discussions with its chairman.\n    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the\nposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.\n    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying\nUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2\nmln shares.\n    \"United has got to consider this proposal. I think the\npilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,\nbut it could put some interesting options in front of UAL\nmanagement,\" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.\n    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack\nwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz\nrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a\nstrategy to become a travel service company.\n    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union\nconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attention\non its airline.\n    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its\nnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.\n    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has\nbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100\ndlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as\nwidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe\nthe stock is in play.\n    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted\nattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a\ncatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps\nthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.\n    \"The first domino is you have an investor with a\nconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That type\nof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,\"\nsaid Pettee.\n    \"What's interesting is the values are there. There's\nsomething for everybody,\" he said.\n\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \"If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \"There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it's not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you're going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross's Collander. \"To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\nreduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\nlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\nlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\nbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\ndefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\nanticipated spending levels for next year.\n    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\nnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \ntaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But since then, Wall Street has been\nspeculating that American Brands would find another candidate\nto help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.\n    \"This is just typical,\" said George Thompson of\nPrudential-Bache securities. \"There's going to be more to come\nhere. American Brands had to make an acquisition because\ntobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position\nis a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,\"\nhe said.\ncash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business\ndoes require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can\ntherefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the\nNational Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin\nand vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the\ntype of acquisition they envisioned.\n    \"The distilled spirits business has been in a steady\ngradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,\"\nsaid Thompson.\n REUTER...\n&#3;",

        "body": "Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler\ncalled on central banks of major industrialised nations to\ncooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.\n    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released\nhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was\nprotectionism and control on capital movements.\n    \"Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market\ntransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have\nthem,\" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would\nhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\nto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\nhad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\ninvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\ndetermined market trends.\n    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\ngrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\nwould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n    \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\nCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\ngoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\nrise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\nof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "New Zealand's ruling Labour Party\ngovernment has just completed its three-year economic reform\nwhich threw thousands of people out of work, yet its popularity\nhas risen as the September deadline for the election draws\ncloser, a recent poll shows.\n    An Eyewitness/Heylen Poll, conducted for Television New\nZealand's Eyewitness news broadcast on April 2, showed Labour\nhad the support of 50 pct of voters compared with the\nopposition National Party's 46 pct.\n    The figures had been reversed in a poll a month earlier.\n    The poll showed 40 pct of the canvassed voters thought the\neconomy would improve over the next year, up 12 points on last\nmonth's result.\n    The increase came in a week when the government turned\nseven departments into nine profit-oriented corporations run by\nbusinessmen who promptly sacked some 4,000 employees, including\nhalf the country's 1,700 coal miners.\n    The latest survey confounded those who proclaimed Labour's\ndays were numbered because of perceived insensitivity to its\ntraditional backers, the workers, political analysts said.\n    The poll indicates people are swinging behind the party and\nthe arguments of Finance Minister Roger Douglas, who has\npresided over the deregulation of the economy and the\nconstruction of one based on market forces without subsidies or\ncurrency controls, the analysts said.\n    The economic reforms, by a party increasingly regarded in\nNew Zealand as more akin to the West European-style Social\nDemocrats than working class socialists, have rattled the\nNational Party, which is now regretting it was not as\ninnovative in the decade it ruled until Prime Minister Robert\nMuldoon was ousted in 1983, one analyst said.\n    The National Party was further shaken, the analyst said,\nwhen the Press, a Christchurch daily, said on April 2 the party\nwas \"on the verge of flying apart\" with the prospect of a coup\nattempt against leader Jim Bolger by Muldoon. Bolger said the\narticle was an April Fool's joke.\n    Labour's reforms have brought unexpectedly strong tax\nrevenues, a lower budget deficit and less state borrowing, an\nimprovement in the balance of payments, a reduction in foreign\ndebt and improved productivity, economists said.\n    Inflation should peak at 19.5 pct in the quarter ended\nMarch 31 and fall to about eight pct within a year, they said.\n    Labour's reforms have hit every sector, but the most\ndramatic was the \"corporatisation\" of seven government\ndepartments on April 1, which critics argue is the first stage\nstep towards the sale of state assets, the analysts said.\n    The move stops short of privatisation, as the state will\nretain ownership, but the new corporations are expected to be\nfinancially self-supporting and pay dividends.\n    Arguments have already broken out over money. One utility,\nElectricorp, said its assets are worth less than 3.8 billion\ndlrs yet the Treasury wants 8.5 billion for them.\n    No agreement has been reached on the value of assets of the\nformer forest service, the analysts added.\n    Chairman Alan Gibbs said in a speech the forest service had\nbeen losing 100 mln dlrs annually, yet due to economies it now\nemployed less than 30 pct of its previous workforce and the new\ncorporation would pay the state a dividend of at least 20 mln\ndlrs in its first year.\n    Uncertainties have also arisen over the government, as the\nonly shareholder, retaining the right to order the new\ncorporations to undertake certain projects although the full\ncost must be met by the state, the analysts said.\n    Deputy prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said managers would\nbe held accountable for performance, with the government paying\nfor projects undertaken for social or environmental reasons.\n    This policy has already caused problems, the analysts\nadded. For example, Electricorp has refused to spend several\nhundred million dlrs to build a hydro project at Luggate,\nfurther up the Clutha river from the Clyde high dam now under\nconstruction in Central Otago.\n    Prime Minister David Lange said this week that Labour MPs\nhad decided last year that Luggate be built and it was\nimportant that the government honour its promises.\n    \"But it is also a matter of importance that we do not see\nmany more jobs lost because of economic distortion than we\nwould save by having that promise honoured to the last,\" he\nadded.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and\nTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force\nto be reckoned with, political analysts said.\n    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.\nAnd Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of\na lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,\nthey said.\n    \"The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of\na key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,\"\nsaid one diplomatic source.\n    \"They are a potent political force,\" the diplomatic source\nsaid.\n    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not\nalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts\nsaid.\n    \"The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not\nso internationalized,\" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru\nUchida. \"Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world\ncommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to\nface the situation.\"\n    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with\nLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep\na major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in\nJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business.\n    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival\ngroups, arguing the market cannot support more than one\ncompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now\nmonopolizes the business.\n    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned\nmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on\nthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.\n    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has\nthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger\nplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open\nits telecommunications market.\n    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it\nsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car\ntelephone and satellite communications market.\n    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the\nsector it regulates.\n    \"What has been happening is an important shift in the\neconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,\" said\nJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory\nService Inc.\n    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to\ncompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted\nrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.\n    \"With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto\nlegal framework,\" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell\nWhitten.\n    Close links with the powerful political faction of the\nruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime\nMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the\nanalysts said.\n    \"Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka\nfaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance\nof MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\nthe influential political group, he added.\n    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\nthe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\nPostal Savings System, analysts said.\n    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\ninterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\nliberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\nSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than\nbanks, they said.\n    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's\nobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\nthe ministry as feudal.\n    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\ncompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\nwing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\nprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of\nits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\nincluding Britain, several analysts said.\n    \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n\"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\nin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\nview,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The candidate is one of several\nconservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry\nagainst Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.\n    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down\nbefore the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10\nif the LDP lost too many major local seats.\n    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his\nparty to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and\nanalysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.\n    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of\npolling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.\n    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the\ngovernorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre\nparties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,\nwho is supported by the opposition socialist and communist\nparties.\n    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.\n    \"The LDP and the centrist parties should have about\n1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the\nincumbent and has the sales tax weapon,\" said Rei Shiratori,\nprofessor of political science at Dokkyo University.\n    \"Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if\nthe LDP wins in Fukuoka,\" he said.\n    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the\ngovernorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.\n    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei\nUniversity, said, \"Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if\nthe LDP loses only in Hokkaido.\"\n    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales\ntax proposal.\n    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to\noverhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36\nyears.\n    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese\ndomestic demand and cut back on exports. Without the tax\nrevenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating\nthe economy.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "China is likely to succeed in joining\nGATT despite policies that contradict free trade, because\nwestern countries support its entry, western diplomats said.\n    China applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and\nTrade (GATT) in July 1986. The organisation, formed in 1948 to\nintegrate the world's free market economies, now regulates 80\npct of world trade.\n    The GATT secretariat is expected to submit a list of\ndetailed questions to China next month at the start of long and\ncomplex entry negotiations, the diplomats said.\n    One diplomat said China's prospects are good, with its\napplication supported by the United States, Japan and the\nEuropean Community for political and economic reasons.\n    \"The fear is that if China was refused entry, it would draw\nback the bamboo curtain and go back to the way it was,\" he said.\n    Another said the Soviet Union was waiting in the wings.\n    \"If GATT accepted China, it would be hard not to accept the\nSoviet Union,\" he said.\n    \"China's agreement will be seen as a model for the Soviet\nUnion. GATT is not a political body.\"\n    But serious problems have to be tackled during the talks,\nincluding China's pricing system and trade subsidies.\n    GATT is based on free trade and aims to lower tariffs and\npromote trade, with prices alone dictating who buys what.\n    One diplomat said it was very hard in China to establish\nthe real cost of goods because many prices are set by the state\nand often contain subsidies.\n    \"Even when you go in person to a factory or a company to try\nto find out the real cost of something, officials do not give\nyou a clear answer. The political meaning is evident. They do\nnot want to answer,\" he said.\n    China's position, as set out in a memorandum to GATT in\nFebruary, is that it is gradually reforming its price system to\nbring prices in line with real production costs and replace\nadministrative controls with market ones.\n    Another diplomat said countries with centralised economies\nsuch as Hungary and Yugoslavia had joined GATT. However, China\nwould not apply for membership on similar terms, but rather as\na less developed country entitled to preferential treatment.\n    He added that the economies of Hungary and Yugoslavia are\nsmall, while China's is huge and its weight would be felt.\n    \"It (China) is the world's number two producer of coal, for\ninstance,\" the diplomat said. \"It could have a very large impact\non world trade.\"\n    Another sticking point is the subsidies China pays its\ncompanies to export so it can earn foreign exchange to pay for\nvitally needed technology, equipment and raw materials.\n    A Japanese trader said China lost money on every tonne of\ngrain it exported, because it had to make up the difference\nbetween a low world price and a high domestic price.\n    A western diplomat said an official of a foreign trade\nbureau of a major inland Chinese city told him export subsidies\nmight be as high as 100 pct for some products.\n    \"When I asked what the subsidy figure was for the whole\ncountry, he referred me to the Ministry of Finance, adding with\na grin that they would not tell me,\" he said.\n    He said officials were unwilling to give figures because of\nthe sensitivity of the subject.\n    \"Unless something is done to change this, China will find\nmany countries in GATT putting restrictions on imports from\nChina,\" the diplomat added.\n    In a major speech on the economy late last month, Planning\nMinister Song Ping made an indirect reference to this problem.\n    \"While trying to expand exports to earn more foreign\nexchange, we must improve economic accounting practices and\nreduce the cost of exports,\" he said.\n    One diplomat said China's freedom to change its foreign\ntrade and pricing system to bring them more in line with GATT\nprinciples could conflict with domestic pressures. China has\nsaid there will be no major price reforms this year following\nwidespread discontent in 1985 and 1986 from a public used to\nstable prices since the Communist takeover in 1949.\n    \"So the question is how fast and how thoroughly can China\nreform its economy?,\" the diplomat said. \"How can it balance the\nrequirements of GATT membership with domestic political needs?\"\n    But he added the advantages of China's entry would in the\nend outweigh these problems.\n    \"China's entry would force it to modernise and become more a\npart of the world economy,\" he said.\n    \"Just as China would get increased access to foreign\nmarkets, so it would have to give more access to its domestic\nmarket to foreign countries.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He made clear that he was\nnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.\n    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar\ngained slight background support from the speculation.\n    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80\npct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money\nmarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may either\noffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate\nand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.\n    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less\nthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact\nexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could\nmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.\n    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative\ncapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of\nwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.\n    \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity.\"\n    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the\ngenerally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the\nfirst time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a\ncounterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.\nREUTER^M\n&#3;",

But he\nadded night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forming\nlinks with Far Eastern exchanges, although nothing had been\ndecided.\n    Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate,\nhe cited products concerning debt and equity.\n    The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 P.M.\nChicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT), which is 8:00 to 11:00 A.M. In\nTokyo, and trading will be limited to four contracts -- U.S.\nTreasury note and bond futures and options, he said.\n    Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and the\nLondon International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE),\ncombined with yen bond futures listings on both, would multiply\nvolume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders.\n    Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseas\nis a prerequisite for expanded futures trading, traders said.\n    LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead from\nSeptember, possibly coinciding with the CBOT, traders said.\n    The CBOT applied for permission to offer a long-term\nJapanese government bond futures contract on March 17, and the\nauthorities must rule on the request within a year.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This showed how\nstrongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and\neffective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.\n    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed\neconomic measures, such as early implementation of a large\nsupplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and\nunprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.\n    It did not mention any figure for the projected\nsupplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount\nto more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares\nwith 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.\n    \"It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative\nfiscal policies of the past,\" said Kazuaki Harada, senior\nmanaging director of Sanwa Research Institute.\n    For the last five years the government has stuck to a\ntight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing\ndeficit financing bonds by 1990.\n    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its\neconomy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the\ngovernment to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it\nto the latest G-7 meeting.\n    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy\nas the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world\neconomic growth.\n    \"The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership\nrole and we should recognize it,\" Harada said.\n    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it\nwill invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,\nWhich may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.\n    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's\ncommitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a\nmore balanced world trade structure, they said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

We say we are just trying to catch\nup with them.\"\n    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to\nadopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital\nequivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two\ncountries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.\n    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little\nhope that would happen soon as they just introduced new\nregulations governing capital ratios last May.\n    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a\ncapital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of\noverseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for\nJapanese banks with overseas branches.\n    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's\nbanks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of\nJapanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.\n    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have\ncapital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are\nwell above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking\nclimb of Tokyo share prices.\n    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too\nhigh by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to\nrealize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell\nthe shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.\n    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying\nthat studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show\nthat prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.\n    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.\nJapanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up\napplications for bank licenses by Japanese financial\ninstitutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of\ntheir hidden reserves.\n    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the\nFed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks\non the subject.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\nwith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\nMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\nin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\nthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\npossibly to 140 yen.\n    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\na dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\nunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\nsentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\noperators to test the downside.\n    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\nWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\ncurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\nworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\nnear term, the traders said.\n    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\ncommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\ndownward trend.\n    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\nfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\ndefend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n\"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The\nU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\nunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\nEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\nmarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\n    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\nthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\nmarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\nvolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\n    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\ncommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\nfurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\n    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\n1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\naccord's supposed currency target range.\n    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\nready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\n    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\ncontributing to greater stability.\n    \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\nboost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\nexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\nin the next three months.\n    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said\nthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations and\nshould not have produced disappointment.\n    \"The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade\npolicies to redress current imbalances are of a different\ntimescale than currency markets operate on,\" the source told\nReuters, \"This is a political process which takes time.\"\n    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in\nBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on\ncurrency markets today. \"Did people really expect a patent\nremedy?\" he asked.\n    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only\nthe first in a series and said the market would watch carefully\nin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.\n    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was\nnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by\nJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could\nlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.\n    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in\npushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months\nwhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to\nsupport the Paris accord.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The company said its\nrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a\nchange in accounting practice. It added that revenues would\nhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.\n    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly\ndue to its life insurance business.\n    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose\ndespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and\nhigher personal risks.\n    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage\ninsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.\n    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and\nlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change\nin accounting for U.S. Annuities.\n    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal\ninvestment influences that it should be accounted differently\nfrom the more traditional insurances.\n    This change in accounting practice and another change to\naccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,\nresulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln\nguilders.\n    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits\nwere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial\ncosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The\nHague.\n    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged\nin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial\ncosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.\n    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in\nMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these\ncosts and made only a small contribution to the group's\nprofits.\n    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill\nfor Monumental Corp.\n    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December\n1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.\n  REUTER\n&#3;",

Dealers restrained their underlying\nbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting\nof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven\nindustrialized nations in Washington.\n    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a\ncommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's\nview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent\nwith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability\nshould be fostered around these levels.\n    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.\n    \"They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with\nfundamentals when it was 154.

They anticipated a concerted effort to prop\nup the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market\nintervention and public comments.\n    Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of\nJapan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of\ndollars.

She said there was some resistance to further climbs.\n    However, she said the dollar could break out of the range\nwith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.\nMerchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.\n    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd\nin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against\nthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,\npossibly to 140 yen.\n    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects\na dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.\n    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb\nunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative\nsentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank\noperators to test the downside.\n    Concern that finance ministers and officials still in\nWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour of\ncurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with\nworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the\nlong term, the traders said.\n    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the\ncommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's\ndownward trend.\n    Traders in several centres said the market would look for\nfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to\ndefend current ranges, which the communique said were \"broadly\nconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy\nintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.\"\n    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said\n\"They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon.\" The\nU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.\n    However, some dealers said London-based operators would be\nunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long\nEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\nmarks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\n    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\nthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\nmarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\nvolatility seen in the first few months of this year.\n    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\ncommunique made clear the leading nations did not want a\nfurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\n    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\n1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\naccord's supposed currency target range.\n    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\nready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\n    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\ncontributing to greater stability.\n    \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\nboost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\nexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\nin the next three months.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears.\n    Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary\nBaker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the\nlight of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "India's private businessmen say they\nhave been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from\nthe capital market because government companies are wooing\ninvestors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.\n    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although\nequity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms\nprovide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fast\nlosing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth\nand income taxes.\n    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into\ngovernment company bonds because of their tax-free status and\neasy transferability.\n    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue\nequity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal\n1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from public\nsector bonds, a merchant banker said.\n    They included equity shares and rights issue worth one\nbillion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata\nFertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponed\nindefinitely.\n    \"The government bonds are making serious inroads on the\nprivate sector companies' resources,\" said R. P. Goenka,\npresident of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and\nIndustry.\n    \"The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with\nand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise\nresources from the market which is common to both,\" Goenka said.\n    A senior Finance Ministry official said government and\nprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, adding\nit was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were\npreventing private firms from raising money on the stock\nmarket.\n    \"Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies\nstill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in\nstock exchanges,\" the ministry official said.\n    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani\nsaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or\nabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and\nnon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.\n    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupees\nmobilised in 1985/86, he said. \"To save taxes, commercial banks,\nmainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investing\ntheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds,\" he said.\n    \"Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the\nbonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going\nfor equities or debentures floated by private companies on a\nselective basis,\" the spokesman said.\n    The maturity period of government company bonds varies\nbetween seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes are\npayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct\ninterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^M\nexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.\n    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and\n12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private\ncompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from\nthe tax on income earned from them.\n    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on\nIndia's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely on\nthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can\nonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.\n    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in\nthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal tax\nconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.\n    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the first\ngovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billion\nrupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of private\ncompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond was\noversubscribed three times, brokers said.\n    Official figures show bonds floated by government companies\nhave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies have\nsought the Ministry's permission to issue them in coming\nmonths.\n    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51\nbillion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by the\nFinance Ministry.\n    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupees\nlast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month the\nIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcription\ntotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.\n    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies to\nmaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.\n    Goenka said that government bonds are making it\nincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch new\nequity or debenture issues. He said the government could at\nleast \"fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through\nsuch bonds by the public sector.\"\n    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state\ncompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financial\nsupport to them.\n    To ease its internal debt burden, the government has\nreduced the budgetary support to development investment in\nabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in\n1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figures\nshow.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The association is expected to\nrelease its estimates later today or on friday.\n    The analysts said they expect strong March performance both\nin new orders and actual sales.\n    Michael Gumport, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc,\nprojected the three-month average of new computer chip orders\nat about 835 mln dlrs, up from 788 mln dlrs in February.\n    He put three-month average sales at about 720 mln dlrs,\nalso an increase from the 700 mln dlrs reported last month.\n    Gumport said average new orders over 850 mln dlrs would be\na plus for semiconductor industry stocks, while orders under\n800 would be interpreted negatively on Wall Street.\n    Gumport said cut backs in Japanese computer chip production\nare aiding U.S. chip maker orders and sales.\n    Edward White, analyst with E.F. Hutton Group Inc, said\nwhile Japanese cut backs may be a small factor, their effect\nshould be more readily apparant in April and May.\n    White, who put the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.15-1.16,\nsaid the ratio might hit 1.20 later this spring, before showing\na normal seasonal decline during the summer.\n    He forecast three-month average orders at 825 mln dlrs for\nMarch, with three-month average billings at about 711 mln dlrs.\n    \"This says the industry is still in a phase of moderate\nrecovery...it is not dramatic yet,\" said White.\n    He said the industry still has not seen a pick-up in high\ntechnology capital spending needed to create a strong recovery.\n    He said a boost in spending on such big-ticket items as\nmainframe computers would enhance the recovery, which is now\nfocused on personal and small business computers.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak agreed the\nindustry is showing a recovery trend, that while encouraging,\nis not dramatic.\n    Kubiak projected the March book-to-bill ratio at 1.14. He\nsaid the three-month average for orders will be up about 4.5\npct from last month, while shipments rise about one pct.\n    He noted, however, orders during the month of March alone,\na statistic the Semiconductor Industry Association does not\npublish, should show a 15-20 pct rise from February orders.\n    Kubiak said a book to bill ratio of 1.14 would have little\nor no effect on semincondutor industry stocks, while a ratio of\n1.13 would be negative for the market and a ratio of 1.16 would\nlikely cause the stocks to rise.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

New industry orders fell 1.9\npct after they had been unchanged in December.\n    Bank economists said that the two together showed the\neconomy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter\nof 1987.\n    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a\nsteady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark\nrate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto\nPoehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF\nmeeting.\n    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates\non repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase\ntender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, \"Since the central\nbank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14\ndays, this is hardly probable.\"\n    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved\naway from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of\ntargetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no\ncomment on the subject while negotiations were still in\nprogress in Washington.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The yen sank below 145 at one point\ndespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\n    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the\nmovement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\nranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\n    \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\nseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\ndiscussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\n    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\nannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\nMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's\nmeetings of leading industrial nations.\n    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\n\"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\nAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\nbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\n    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\nGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\nrepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\nfoster exchange rate stability.\n    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\nbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\ndollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\nintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\nyears. Monetary sources also said they understood that\nSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\nsuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\n    They also said there was a growing feeling among the\nfinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\nmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\ndifferences in past meetings.\n    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\nthe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\nyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other\ncountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\n    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\nmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\nbetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's\ntrade deficit have already taken place.\n    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\nthe budget deficit even though it is implied in the\nreafffirmation of Paris.\n    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\nessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\nreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\n    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\nweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\nsharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\nsubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\nundermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\n    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\npolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\n    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\nwelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\ncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\n    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\ndollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the\nJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\n    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\ntheir policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\nFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\n    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\nto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\n    The United States and France, backed by the International\nMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\nlimited number of economic objectives such as growth,\ninflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\naccount balances.\n    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\nconsultations between the countries on whether corrective\naction should be required.\n    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\nhas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\nimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\n    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\nsounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\ncurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\n    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\nof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\nrelatively free currency markets of recent years.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

They had hoped that new vitality in the\nindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil\nprices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope\nwith growing mounds of debt.\n    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed\nthe industrial country economies would move up to an annual\ngrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.\n    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some\ntime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into\nan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.\n    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier\nstates for markets for their products as well as financial\nassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' \neconomies poses fundamental worries.\n    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have\nonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,\nincluding the key one of exports.\n    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,\nhas served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it\ntoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only\n2.3 pct, according to the IMF.\n    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the\nUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to\nignite their economies but with little apparent success.\n    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and\nthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade\ndeficit.\n    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the\nimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much\nslower than expected.\n    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that \"it has\nto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to\nwork through to payments flows -- probably at least three years\nto get a resonably complete effect.\"\n    The report added, however, \"the adjustments may take even\nmore time on this occasion.\"\nREUTER^M\n&#3;",

The government's perceived need to control inflation by\nkeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.\n    High real interest rates were attracting an influx of\nspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting the\ngovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.\n    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,\nliquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17\npct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a\ntarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.\n    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money\nrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from\n11.8 at end-1986.\n    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to\nhold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,\nwith increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new\nwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.\n    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish\nworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.\n    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the\nstate sector, where the government is trying to impose its five\npct wage ceiling.\n    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in\nSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first\ntwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct\nincrease over the corresponding period last year.\n    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the\npeseta to correct the imbalance.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Although the company said it would meet\ncommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\nper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\nand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\nU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\na regular supplier to the world market.\n    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\nhave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\nquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\nin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\nfirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\norder was filled by merchants in March.\n    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\nthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\nestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\ndelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four.

The stock\nslipped 1/2 to 71-1/2 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.\n    She said the Moreno's downgrade of UAL was because the\n\"stock had risen to a level beyond what current fundamentals\ncan support.\" The stock has risen more on merger speculation\nthan on fundamentals, the opinion continued.\n    In recent weeks, rumors UAL stock was being accumulated for\na possible takeover bid shored up the stock, traders and\nanalysts said. In addition, pilots of UAL's United Airlines\nunit proposed a buyout of the airline for 4.5 billion dlrs.\n    The Smith Barney spokeswoman said the postive\nrecommendation of AMR emphasizes the company's strong marketing\nability, its good management and customer loyalty to the AMR\nname.

In 1988, the company\nis expected to earn six dlrs a share.\n    Traders said other airline stocks moved higher today\nprimarily as a result of fare hikes announced Wednesday by\nTexas Air &lt;TEX>, United Airlines and AMR.\n    Delta &lt;DAL> rose 1/2 to 56-7/8, NWA Inc &lt;NWA> 3/8 to 66,\nand Pan Am &lt;PN> 1/8 to 4-5/8.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The important thing is that it\ncontinue year after year,\" Lawson said.\n    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to\nstabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six\nweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against\nthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.\n    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in\nthe Louvre accord, he said, \"I don't think so. If there had been\nno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"\n    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\nsaid, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n... but one has to be vigilant.\"\n    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n\"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n\"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the\nsame thing,\" he said.\n    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\nmeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\nweakness for that agreement.\n    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's\npresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\ndomestic demand.\n    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\nincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\nalso involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\nthe second half of this year.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

They recommend taking profits.\n    \"It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said\nCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be\nstrong for about two months, and there are signs that some\n(order rates) are starting to dive already.\"\n    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\nsome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\n&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel\nIndustries Inc &lt;IAD>.\n    \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\nshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\nrising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\nhowever, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\nmake them more efficient.\n    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to\nrecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\n    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\nsheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\nhas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\nnoted. \"It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but\nthey've come a long way,\" he said.\n    \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the\nmarket,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\ncould go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\nbefore special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\nagainst losses last year.\n    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\nsaid.\n    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\non it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\nit,\" he said.\n    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\nshare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\nfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\ndepends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales\ncome from oil and natural gas.\n    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\nSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company's done a lot\n(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit\nfor,\" she said.\n    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\ntrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\nshare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n1986.\n    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\nbeen recommending the stocks since last November.\n    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\nalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\nthird quarter.\n    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)\nprices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"\nhe said.\n    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\ndropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than\nnegatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\nindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\ncause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

We say we are just trying to catch\nup with them.\"\n    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to\nadopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital\nequivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two\ncountries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.\n    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little\nhope that would happen soon as they just introduced new\nregulations governing capital ratios last May.\n    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a\ncapital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of\noverseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for\nJapanese banks with overseas branches.\n    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's\nbanks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of\nJapanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.\n    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have\ncapital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are\nwell above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking\nclimb of Tokyo share prices.\n    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too\nhigh by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to\nrealize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell\nthe shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.\n    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying\nthat studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show\nthat prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.\n    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.\nJapanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up\napplications for bank licenses by Japanese financial\ninstitutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of\ntheir hidden reserves.\n    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the\nFed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks\non the subject.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Lloyd's of London has offered to meet\npart of the 235 mln stg in claims that investors in PCW\nUnderwriting Agencies face due to fraud and mismanagement,\nchairman Peter Miller said at a press conference.\n    Miller urged 3,000 PCW members to accept the offer so that\nthe five-year-old affair could be closed.\n    The members have until May 30 to accept the offer,\ninvolving a 103 mln stg payment by Lloyd's and some of Lloyd's\nunderwriters in exchange for a 34 mln stg contribution from PCW\nmembers, he said.\n    Miller said that at end-1985, PCW syndicates had gross\nliabilities of 680 mln stg.\n    To offset this, they had assets, including cash and\npayments from reinsurance policies on some of the risks\nunderwritten by the syndicates, of 445 mln stg, leaving net\nliabilities of 235 mln, he said.\n    The total sum on offer, including a 48 mln stg payment from\nLloyd's 311 mln stg contingency fund and 55 mln stg from\nLloyd's brokers who could otherwise face court cases for their\ninvolvement in PCW, is designed to cover the full reinsurance\ncost for those 235 mln stg of net liabilities, Miller said.\n    Under the offer, which requires 90 pct acceptance, Lloyd's\nitself would take over all members' future obligations\nconnected with the PCW syndicates, Miller said. Members would\nhave to agree not to pursue the matter in court.\n    Miller said a rejection of the offer would probably lead to\nprotracted litigation in court which, even if succesful for\nmembers, was unlikely to produce a better deal for them.\n    He added that acceptance would mean members could continue\nunderwriting in the Lloyd's market and qualify for tax relief\non the cash payments they would make towards the settlement.\n    Miller denied that PCW members would face bills of over\n200,000 stg.\n    He said only 34 members would be asked to pay between\n100,000 and 200,000 stg, and about 100 between 60,000 and\n100,000 stg. Special arrangements would be sought for those who\naccept the offer but are unable to pay.\n    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's accepted\nresponsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of\n1982 when \"it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) Peter\nCameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetrated\ntheft upon members,\" he said.\n    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered and\nrepaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairs\nof PCW syndicates \"in a state of chaos which led to a sharp\ndeterioration of their underwriting results,\" Miller said. Both\nwere fined by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee and expelled\nfrom membership.\n    He said Lloyd's would continue to seek reparation in\nBritish and U.S. Courts \"with the utmost vigour ... To bring to\na close one of the most shameful episodes in the history of\nLloyd's,\" and was contemplating claiming the full amount of the\nsettlement now on offer from Cameron Webb and Dixon.\n    In a reaction, insurance brokerage Sedgwick Group Plc\n&lt;SDWK.L> said it supported Lloyd's proposals and had\ncontributed 10 mln stg towards the proposed settlement.\n    It said in a statement, \"as largest broker in the Lloyd's\nmarket, the company has an essential interest in maintaining\nthe reputation of the market. That reputation has been damaged\nby problems at PCW and will continue to be so as long as they\nremain unresolved.\" It had contributed to the proposed\nsettlement to avoid costs related to the defence of some of its\nsubsidiaries which had been named as potential defendants to\nlitigation by PCW members, it said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This year, Wallis said the\nU.S. will press for a statement instructing trade ministers to\nbegin negotiating on the issue, and include domestic programs.\n    While the Western leaders, including president Reagan, will\nnot conduct specific negotiations, Wallis said they can give a\npush to the agriculture talks under the General Agreement on\nTariffs and Trade (GATT).\n    Wallis said the leaders should endorse a \"comprehensive\"\nnegotiation, which is interpreted as including domestic\npolicies as well as import restraints and export subsidies.\n    \"They (GATT talks) really have to deal with domestic\npolicies, as well as trade arrangements,\" Wallis said.\n    Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has said a summit\nstatement of support for agriculture talks is part of an\noverall U.S. strategy to build momentum for the GATT farm\ntalks.\n    Public statements in recent weeks by several members of the\nReagan cabinet have stressed the agriculture issue.\n    Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will\nrepeatedly discuss agriculture during a visit to Japan starting\nnext week. Yeutter said agriculture will also be on the agenda\nof the trade ministers \"quadrilateral\" talks among\nJapan, the European Community, the U.S. and Canada this month.\n    And the ministerial meeting of the Paris-based Organization\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in May will\nhighlight the agriculture problem, Yeutter said.\n    The OECD in May is expected to release a study of domestic\nfarm subsidies which shows that Japan has the highest subsidies\namong industrial countries, but aid to farmers is also generous\nin the EC and United States.\n    The controversial OECD study calculated a measure of farm\nsubsidies called the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, which\nallows farm aid to be compared across countries.\n    Some officials including British Agriculture Minister\nMichael Jopling, have said the PSE could be useful as a method\nof negotiating lower domestic farm subsidies worldwide.\n    However, the State Department's Wallis said while the PSE\ncan be useful in negotiations, it has shortcomings and \"its not\ndefinitive.\"\n    He and other U.S. officials said the Reagan administration\nhas not yet reached a decision on a specific U.S. agriculture\nproposal to present to the GATT.\n    \"I would expect it (U.S. proposal) to be in the fall,\"\nafter the series of international meetings, Wallis said.\n    At preliminary meetings of the GATT agriculture committee,\nthe United States has pushed for the so-called \"freeze and\nrollback\" approach. Subsidies would first be frozen at current\nlevels, then rolled-back jointly in stages.\n    However, the Reagan administration perplexed some trade\nanalysts recently by reacting cooly to a plan by Australian\nprime minister Bob Hawke calling for a similar approach. Hawke\nunveiled a seven-point plan to freeze and subsequently reduce\nthe gap between high farm price supports and world prices.\n    Australia is leading a the so-called Cairns group of 13\ncoutries pressing for freer agriculture trade.\n    \"The proposals that the so-called Cairns group are coming\nup with seem to be focusing on short-run, quick fixes which is\nnot what we think is what's called for here,\" Wallis said.\n    Wallis and other said the U.S. wants a \"long-range\"\nsolution to the agriculture problem.\n    U.S. officials also have criticized the Australian proposal\nbecause they said it deals primarily with the difference\nbetween domestic prices and world levels in the EC and U.S.,\nbut fails to focus on the question of market access.\n    At the same time the U.S. is rejecting the Australian\n\"quick fix\", Wallis said the U.S. will press at the summit for\na declaration urging that agriculture talks be completed\n\"expeditiously\", or within two years.\n    The unstated U.S. strategy, U.S. officials said, is to keep\nthe pressure on the EC this year through the export enhancement\nprogram and lower value of the dollar, in the hope that a\nsweeping agriculture agreement is possible in 1988.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This\nyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three\nweeks later than last year.\n    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said\nsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a\nseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted\n5.7 pct last year.\n    \"The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate\nthat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear\nto be because liquidity and employment are rising,\" said\nanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.\n    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in\naccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected\nto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.\n     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket\nitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many\nanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the\nholiday nears.\n    \"Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a\ncontinuing strength in the housing market,\" said Edward\nBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an\noverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's\nsportswear were also excellent.\n    \"Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even\na modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment\ndue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,\"\nsaid C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. \n    J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were\namong the weaker performers with comparable stores sales\ndeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and\ncatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's\noverall sales rose 4.8 pct.\n    Penney chairman William Howell said, \"Sales continued\nstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from\nvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressed\nsouthwest.\"\n    \"Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity\nwear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,\nbut are currently hurting sales,\" said Greenstein of Bear\nStearns.\n    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for\nthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that \"Hudson had a tougher\ncomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.\"\n    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower\nthan last year.\n    \"Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are\nbeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales\nare coming through anyway,\" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.\n    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  \nbe better than he had originally expected in the beginning of\nthe year.\n    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of\nMay.\n     MARCH RETAIL SALES FOR MAJOR U.S. RETAILERS\n    STORE       PCT        1987       1986\n    SEARS       4.2     2.6 BIL       2.5 BIL \n    K MART      4.6     2.2 BIL       2.1 BIL \n    JC PENNEY  (1.3)    1.1 BIL       1.1 BIL \n    WAL-MART     32     1.1 BIL       855 MLN\n    FEDERATED   4.9     934 MLN       891 MLN\n    MAY         3.5     885 MLN       855 MLN\n    DAYTON      4.8     792 MLN       756 MLN\n    WOOLWORTH   0.2     591 MLN       590 MLN\n    ZAYRE      12.7     522 MLN       464 MLN\n Reuter\n&#3;",

However, by the close of\ntrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide\nin aftermarket activity.\n    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a\nnewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.\nFor example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs\nat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that\nbecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the\nlast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.\n    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended\nto compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty\ncurrently associated with owning dollar securities.\n    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in\ndollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the\nonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.\nJapan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.\n    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into\nyen as the borrowers previous issues were.\n    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees\nat less 1.75 less 1.55.\n    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from\nToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8\npct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.\n    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,\nthe largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui\nChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has\nequity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on\nbrokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.\n    The Australian dollar market continued active, with\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln\nfive-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.\n    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A\nsimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly\nhigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was\nquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.\n    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to\naccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less\nthan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail\nbuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates\nfall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for\ncapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also\nbetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.\n    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are\napparently being placed with retail accounts on the European\ncontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.\n    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on\ndomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as\nthe yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to\n144 yen.\n    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen\nissue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second\nseven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve\nin Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must\nbe provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the difference\nin information requirements between notes and public bonds,\naccording to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.\n    The convention requires that lead managers draw up a\nprospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain\ndetails about the borrower.\n    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus must\nmerely be made available to clients on request via all\nsyndicate banks rather than published and distributed in\nprinted form.\n    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier this\nmonth, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and\ndeals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly\nanachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.\n    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the\namount of information that should be provided by borrowers,\nheightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on\nrecent occasions .\n    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swiss\nfrancs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly with\ncustomers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.\n    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by the\nunchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.\n    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage\nthat the new requirement would present them with problems or\npush up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time been\nproviding more than the legal minimum of information.\n    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they were\nalso known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000\nfrancs and placed largely with institutional investors.\n    They were normally not brought onto the open market and\nnever quoted on the stock exchange.\n    But over the years the distinction between notes and the\npublicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. The\nNational Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining\nrestrictions on maturities and denominations which still\nformally divided them.\n    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bank\nto rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely\nas before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,\nhave been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,\nvirtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with\n\"information memorandums\" with varying degrees of detail.\n    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It says\neach notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:\n    - The precise terms of the issue\n    - Details of the company performance if it is more than six\nmonths since the last annual report\n    - Naming of all guarantors\n    - The source of the information\n    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made\n    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company's\nshares are listed and price high and lows over at least the\nlast three years.\n    - That the lead manager has required the borrower to\nprovide information during the lifetime of the notes on the\nprogress of his business.\n     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total note\nissues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francs\nlast year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in the\nform of public bonds.\n    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Its 1986 sales\nwere two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says it\nexpects sales of 2.7 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987.\nSony's other two French plants, in the south west of the\ncountry, export over 80 per cent of their production.\n    Company officials say that production from Sony's European\nfactories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of the\ngroup's European sales and they expect this to increase. In\n1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwide\nsales were made in Europe.\n    At the beginning of 1987, Sony employed about 1,100 people\nin Europe.

The candidate is one of several\nconservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry\nagainst Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax.\n    Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down\nbefore the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10\nif the LDP lost too many major local seats.\n    Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his\nparty to its greatest-ever election victory last July, and\nanalysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline.\n    Over 2,500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of\npolling. The first round is on Sunday, the second on April 26.\n    Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the\ngovernorship of Fukuoka, southern Japan. The LDP and two centre\nparties are challenging the incumbent governor, Hachiji Okuda,\nwho is supported by the opposition socialist and communist\nparties.\n    The proposed tax is a key campaign issue.\n    \"The LDP and the centrist parties should have about\n1,350,000 votes against 700,000 for Okuda. But Okuda is the\nincumbent and has the sales tax weapon,\" said Rei Shiratori,\nprofessor of political science at Dokkyo University.\n    \"Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if\nthe LDP wins in Fukuoka,\" he said.\n    Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the\ngovernorship of the northern island of Hokkaido.\n    But Kenzo Uchida, professor of political science at Hosei\nUniversity, said, \"Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if\nthe LDP loses only in Hokkaido.\"\n    The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales\ntax proposal.\n    The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to\noverhaul the tax system, which has remained unchanged for 36\nyears.\n    It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese\ndomestic demand and cut back on exports.

Nivison and Co.\n    The debentures are due June 1, 2002 and pay a semi-annual\ncoupon of two pct and are priced at par. They can be converted\ninto shares of the company's stock at 23-1/2 dlrs a share.\n    IRT's shares closed last night on the New York Stock\nExchange at 19-7/8.\n    The debentures can be redeemed at par at maturity and are\ncallable at the company's option after the first two years.\n    On or after August 1989 the company can call half the\ndebentures if the stock trades for 30 days at 123 pct of the\nconversion price and half if it reaches 140 pct of the\nconversion price, Nivison said.\n    In addition, holders will be able to surrender half the\nbonds during May 1991 at 123 pct for a semi-annual yield of\n7.043 pct and the other half in May 1993 at 140 pct, for a\nyield of 7.383 pct.\n    The payment date is June 1, 1987. The debentures will be\nlisted in London and the fees for the deal total 2-1/4 pct.\n    Nivison said that the deal contains a convenent which\nstates that if the company's debt to equity ratio exceeds two\nto one the debentures cannot be converted unless the company\nobtains a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.\n    Nivison said IRT's debt to equity ratio currently is less\nthan one to one.\n    The Chandler partner said that this type of deal gives the\nborrower funds that are less costly than if it had done an\nissue in the U.S. Domestic market.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion\ndlrs.\n    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\noff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\nU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\nclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\nafternoon trading.\n    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\nperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\nCanadian economy.\n    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\noff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\nU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\nclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\nafternoon trading.\n    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\nperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\nCanadian economy.\n    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at\na torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays\nthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into\nthe country.\n    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United\nStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be\nstrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer\nspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.\n    \"We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export\nperformance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland's\nDonegan.\n    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist\nWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and\nsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February's\ntrade upturn.\n    Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing\nsigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate\nthat part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is\nprobably transitory.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The\nstockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.\n    He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage\nthe stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.\n    These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget\nand the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.\n    The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile\nmanagement was counter-productive, he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil\nimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.\n    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for\n33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to\n40 pct by 1990.\n    \"However, the rate of this growth can be affected\npositively or negatively through government action or\ninaction,\" Lichtblau said.\n    He said that one of the government's negative actions is\nthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a\ndisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash\nflow for oil exploration.\n    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor\nprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.\n    \"An international floor price adopted by all or most\nindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effective\nmeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if\nwe imposed it alone,\" Lichtblau said.\n    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic\nfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen\nU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.\n    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the\nwillingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.\n    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer\ntax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic\nPetroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans\nfor alternative energy.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.\n    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA was\nconducting a \"smear campaign\" by handing out leaflets at the\ncompany's terminals. The union says it was trying to win public\nsupport by presenting its position.\n     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants for\nhanding out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The\nunion is fighting the move in court.\n     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's\nlatest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was\noffered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,\nwhereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those\nhired before 1983.\n     However, the union has contended that the company's\nproposal keeps the system in a disguised form.\n     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to\nAmerican's announcement.\n     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of\na federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was\ntriggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer\nof binding arbitration.\n     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to\nstrike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its\nlatest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.\n     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not\nstrike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received\npermission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up\nthe hiring of new attendants.\n     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was\nthinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.\n     \"It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,\"\nhe said.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",
