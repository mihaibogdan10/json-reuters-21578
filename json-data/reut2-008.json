        "body": "The U.S. Agriculture Department \nformally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to\ndrastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers\nfor the cut with targeted income payments.\n    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying\nthe \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers,\nDeputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration\nwants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning\nwith the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.\n    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the\ngovernment for the price support cut with targeted income\npayments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would\ncost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\n    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\nintroduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\nJohn Porter, R-Ill.\n    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\nis unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\npolitically-influential sugar and corn growers\nand high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\n    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \ntargets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\nlowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\nany output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\n    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\nwould receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\ncts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\n    The income payments would be based on the amount of\ncommercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\nor 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\n    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\nin the sugar program because the current high price support is\ncausing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\n    He said the current program has artificially stimulated\ndomestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\ncorn sweeteners to make market inroads.\n    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\n\"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\nmln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\nrefiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\n    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\noverseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\ncompetitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of\nsugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing\nfacilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.\n    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on\nU.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said\nconsumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than\nnecessary for sugar.\n    \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between\nsweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse\nimpacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently\nfacing,\" Myers said.\n    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per\nlb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons\nrecoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to\ncompensate sugar growers with targeted payments.\n    QUANTITY            1988     1989      1990      1991\nFirst 350 tons         6.000    4.500     3.000     1.500\nOver 350 to 700        5.750    4.313     2.875     1.438\nOver 700 to 1,000      5.500    4.125     2.750     1.375\nOver 1,000 to 1,500    5.000    3.750     2.500     1.250\nOver 1,500 to 3,000    4.500    3.375     2.250     1.125\nOver 3,000 to 6,000    3.500    2.625     1.750     0.875\nOver 6,000 to 10,000   2.250    1.688     1.125     0.563\nOver 10,000 to 20,000  0.500    0.375     0.250     0.125\nOver 20,000 tons        nil      nil       nil       nil \n Reuter\n&#3;",

The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on\nthe Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.\n    \"We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a\nprolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway\nAuthority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.\n    \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the\nSt Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the\nCanadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major\nCanadian shipping companies, said recently.\n    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The\nassociation said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages\nfor the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to\nrestructure crew dispatching.\n    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs\n(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and\nfreight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985\nwas its worst year in two decades.\n    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on\nthe Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last\nyear's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls\nthroughout the rest of the waterway.\n    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and\nabout 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.\n    \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we\nwon't see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.\n    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers\nin Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this\nseason but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,\nBlair said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The four-times-a-year \"triple\nwitching hour\" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has in\nthe past.\n    Market averages finished sharply higher as stock index\nfutures, index options and options on individual stocks expired\nsimultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may be\nretraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is getting\nused to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity in\nthe final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchange\nsaid the day went smoothly and efficiently.\n    \"This has been one of the few times that the consensus has\nbeen right,\" said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch\nand Co.\n    He expects a \"follow-through\" Monday and Tuesday to the\nadvance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 points\nfor the day and 75 points for the entire week.\n    Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved in\narbitrage activity involving index futures and options, said\nthe general trend of the market has been upward for months.\n\"Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with more\nmoney,\" he said.\n    He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accounts\nprior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japanese\ninvestors are apparently helping push stocks higher.\n    Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc,\nsaid reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end of\nthe fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.\n    He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedged\nwith short positions in index futures rolled the expiring March\nfutures over into June contracts. But he added different\nplayers with other goals also were active and there was no\nsimple explanation of the market's gyrations.\n    For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the June\nStandard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15\nminutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, the\ncontracted dipped to 297.50. \"That could have been a wave of\nselling from institutional people making a roll,\" he said.\n    It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500\nhit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. \"It looks\nlike the market is going to continue to go higher,\" he said.\n    \"Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was a\nstrong day for stocks,\" said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney,\nHarris Upham and Co.\n    Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by\n\"good solid buying interest\" which will cushion any pullback.\n    Other investors who were long futures and short stocks\nbought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, said\nMark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against\n\"over-dramatizing\" the day's activity, which said was more a\nreflection of fundamental strength in the markets.\n    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was\nmostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options\nand individual options expired. He said there could be a\ndecline early next week in the stock market.\n    \"It looked like it worked well today,\" said Howard Kramer,\nasssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and\nExchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have to\nbe analyzed next week.\n    He said there was relatively little commotion at the close,\nwith about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minute\ncompared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three months\nearlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points in\nthe closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.\n    Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility,\ndisclosure of \"market-on-close\" orders in 50 major stocks 30\nminutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances of\nmodest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening out\nvolatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of the\nimbalance.\n    The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47\nstocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, and\nno significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tightened\na rule governing what type of market on close orders can be\naccepted in the final half hour.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in\nadvance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with\nPrime Minister Brian Mulroney.\n    In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs\ngroup, Clark said that the two countries must find better\nmechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.\n    \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on\ncorn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were\nquasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place\nnow are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he\nsaid.\n    Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington's rules\non government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he\nsaid.\n    \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to\nsecure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to\nmove their head offices out of our country into your country\nbecause you have national procurement requirements,\" he said.\n    In turn, he added, the United States would like to change\nsome of the procurement requirements that exist at the\nprovincial government level in Canada.\n    Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.\n    \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in\nthe first instance, to propose, and then governments and\ncongresses will have judge,\" he said.\n    In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States\nhas tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to\nits northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan.\n\"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year\nthan you bought from Canada,\" he said.

John McCain,\nan Arizona Republican, told reporters.\n    \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than\nsanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.\n    The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor\nindustry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department\nofficials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September\n1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United\nStates and other countries.\n    They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through\ntariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for\ncontinuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100\nmln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.\n    Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen.\nPete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is\nthat there will be.\"\n    \"Japan can't just say they will comply. We think sanctions\nmust be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the\nCalifornia Republican said.\n    The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips\nwhich are used in high technology products ranging from radios\nto defence missile guidance systems.\n    Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told\nthem the administration had not made a final determination that\nJapanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below\nthe cost of production in the United States or other countries.\n    But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt\ndumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of\npurchases of the Japanese products.\n    The two countries signed a pact last September in which\nJapan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United\nStates and other countries below production costs and to allow\nthe U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.\n    In return, the United States waived its right to impose\nimport duties on the Japanese microchips.\n    Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact\nand have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to\nsave the pact.\n    Japan has frequently been the target of congressional\ndiscouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade\ndeficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United\nStates last year and had large surpluses with other countries.\n    The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution\ncalling for action against Japan for violations of the pact\nsince September.

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\nfinancing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\n    The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\nBolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\nnext 12 months.\n    Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\nopened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\nClub and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\nBolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\n    Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\nnegotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\nfinalised, had been extremely successful.\n    Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\nBolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\nhad waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\n    Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\n    Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\ndisbursements this year from lender countries and international\nagencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\nthe figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\n    Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\naround 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\nPaz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the\ncapital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had\nchanged from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net\ninflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.\n    Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz\nestenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited\ninflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were\nlosing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on\nthe black market at up to 16 times its official rate.\n    Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market-\nrelated rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off\nthousands of workers in state corporations.\n    Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past\nsix months, according to the Central Bank, and the government \nexpects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct\ncontraction over the last six years.\n    The government is also proposing a novel solution to its\ndebt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest\nhas not been paid since March, 1984.\n    Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would\nmake a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at\nthe price it trades on the international secondary market -- \n10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank\nsteering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\nthe proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\ncountry's creditor banks will take up the offer.\n    One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\nbuy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\ndeal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\nto the country.\n    But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\nscheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\nin Chile for the past two years.\n    The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\ndebt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\nprivatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\nas a basis for such a scheme.\n    Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\nattractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\ngovernment realises that it will have to attract a large amount\nof new capital in order to grow.\n    Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\nthat Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\ninvestment over the next 10 to 12 years.\n    The government realises that in order to remain viable,\nBolivia will need to develop new exports.\n    The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\nBolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\nand gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\nsupply in the region.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

During the hiatus between the two agreements, the\nInternational Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.\n    The pact will enter into force definitively when\ngovernments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct\nof world imports have ratified it.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed\ndiscussions with ministers tomorrow.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely\nhit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and\ngas revenues in half.\n    Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to\nprovide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia\npay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.\n    Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to\nthe oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31\npct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to\nbridge its deficit.\n    Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto\nand leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy\nchange, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost\nprotected economy.\n    \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call\nfor major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said\nin his arrival statement.\n    But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next\nmonth, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that\nthe Bank is demanding specific changes.\n    \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the\neconomy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at\nJakarta airport.\n    Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling\n37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the\nThird World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7\nbillion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.\n    Conable did not spell out what further changes he would\nlike to see.

But there was uncertainty about the\nprospects for exports and investment.\n    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply\novershoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an\neffect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, there\nwere potential dangers in the long run.\n    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the West\nGerman money supply would grow within the three to six pct\ntarget zone set in December.\n    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the\ndrop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for\nsome time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise between\none and two pct this year.\n    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for\nthe West German economy. Although there was a possibility of a\ndownturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this\nwould happen in 1988.\n    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from its\nclose ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This outburst\ncame after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying\ngovernment regulations on price controls.\n    Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance\nMinister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government's\neconomic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The market also faces the regular weekly three- and\nsix-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.\n    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly\nauspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting\nsideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy\nU.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in\nFederal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.\n    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared\nunfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in\nhigh-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.\nEquities.\n    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are\nsigns the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a\nbit.\n    \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,\nand there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly\nreport.\n    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes\nbanks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's\nsales.\n    \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.\nThough the yield spread to the cost of carrying these\nmaturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a\nweekly market review.\n    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate\nenough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the\noverseas markets have had their run.\n    \"Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate\nthat the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists\nat Salomon Brothers Inc.\n    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors\nare planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the\nhigher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year\non April 1.\n    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big\nbuyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.\nAuctions, such reports undermine market confidence.\n    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian\nmonetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies\nshould also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond\nmarkets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.\n    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the\nU.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,\neconomists said.\n    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with\nFebruary durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from\nJanuary's depressed levels.\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said\nseveral areas, including transport equipment, should have\nbounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap\ntotal new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after\nJanuary's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain\nas large as five pct.\n    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to\nshow an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.\nEconomists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the\nJanuary rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food\nprices declined.\n    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate\nwill be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the\napproach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.\n    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this\nweek because its adding requirement increases sharply in the\nnew statement period beginning on Thursday.\n    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected\nto open near that level.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Other clients would have to give up their\nanonymity and reveal their identities to the bank.\n    Commission President Hermann Bodenmann said the Commission\nwas likely to discuss the proposal at today's meeting with the\nbankers, and during its own council session on Tuesday.

This month Makulic imposed\npartial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread\nstrikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army\ncould be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was\nthreatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with\nhard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a\nrecord 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its\noverall debt by 996 mln dlrs.\n    Government ministers told reporters last week they\nregretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the\ncost to the economy had been too great.\n    Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos\nMilosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign\nMinister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, \"radical changes\" in\ninterest rates and repayment times were needed.\n    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those\nof his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen\nahead in financing the debt repayments.\n    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered\nby the Paris club at the end of this month.\n    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed\nthe Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be\nalarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here\nand the possibility of balance of payments problems later this\nyear.\n    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected\nto figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor\nHelmut Kohl.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

It considered those conditions\nunreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly\ntransaction, it said.\n    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.\n    Dart said it requested the information before its meeting\nwith SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope\nrepresentatives would reach an agreement.\n    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told\nthere were certain issues important to SGL management and while\nthey were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take\nthem into account in putting together its package.\n    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln\ndlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice\npresident James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.\n    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'\nseverance agreements, although there was an implication that\nLieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their\nown volition.\n    Dart said under their present agreements, none of these\nofficers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,\nDart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6\nmln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's\nincentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost\nof six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares\nunless waived by the company's compensation committee.\n    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top\nmanagement's supplemental retirement plan.\n    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance\nobligations and future salary guarantees for top management,\nestimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations\nunder the company's present policy.\n    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to\ndiscuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to\nnegotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.\n    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain\nand Rickels home centres.\n    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed\nby an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such\nactions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.\n    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their\nfiduciary duty.\n    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an\nunwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of\nsecurities to shareholders which make a takeover more\nexpensive.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

You can't expect to get very far\nat the first meeting,\" one banker said.\n    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting\nhere of the Inter-American Development Bank.\n    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for\na legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank\ncredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the\nend of March.\n    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough\ncredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs\nto request a formal extension of the commitments to head off\npossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.\n    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will\nendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or\nsimply relay it without comment.\n    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's\nmeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable\nlanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.\n    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day\nrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally\nmatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.\nBankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is\nsubject to the moratorium.\n    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days\noverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on\nnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and when\nthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.\n    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter\nwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.\nOther U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.\n    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and\nsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if\nthere was a way round the problem.\n    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan\nmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could\nhappen.\"\n    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the\ncommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with\nBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the\nproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a\ntime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans\ncan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.\n    \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't\nmeet all its obligations,\" he said.\n    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting\ninflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the\npublic sector budget was in operational surplus.\n    But he said there was a need to spell out government\npolicy, especially on prices.\n    \"It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external\nreasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures\nmight be introduced.\n    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the\nbanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed\nby the country's creditors.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

At a news\nconference last week he warned that Latin defaults were a\ndistinct possibility in the long run.\n    Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no\nway interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the\nissue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time,\nofficials and delegates said.\n    They said creditors are not ready to discuss debt\nforgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity\nswaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic\nreforms.\n    Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions on\nlending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations\nfor the bank if it does not get its way.\n    Latin America, while retaining reservations, now accepts\nthe principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is\nunwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powers\non lending, officials and delegates said.\n    Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35\npct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans are\nunwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. To\nline up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.\n    This attempt to weaken Latin America's voting power, and\nparticularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADB\nunless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable\nresentment among Latin Americans.\n    \"Debtors have already shown considerable willingness to\nsacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is\nnot at issue,\" one Latin American official said.\n    The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of\nIADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as\nagainst 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Its share of the domestic car market rose to 29 pct\nin January and February from 26 pct in the year-ago period.\n    Hahn declined to forecast first quarter 1987 results, or\nanswer questions about the VW currency scandal.\n    Hahn said he did not want to elaborate on statements VW had\nalready issued on the affair and noted the case was now in the\nhands of state prosecutors.\n    VW, like other car manufacturers, had encountered difficult\nmarket conditions in the United States in early 1987, Hahn\nsaid, without giving details.\n    He declined to predict U.S. Sales for 1987 as a whole,\nsaying it was particularly difficult this year to forecast\nsales trends in North America, VW's second largest regional\nmarket after Western Europe.\n    Hahn declined to comment directly on reports that 1986\nlosses at Spanish subsidiary Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles\nde Turismo (SEAT) totalled up to 27 billion pesetas or that\nthese losses were twice as high as expected.\n    But he said SEAT was developing according to plan and added\nthe introduction of international accounting standards and\nchanges to VW's own had led to some corrections to SEAT's\nfigures.\n    VW hoped SEAT would reach break-even point in the course of\nthis year. In 1986 SEAT's volume sales had been better than\nexpected, Hahn said.\n    In January and February, 1987, SEAT's turnover in Europe\nrose 40 pct compared with the same months of 1986, Hahn said.\nIts European market share rose to 1.9 pct in January and\nFebruary from 1.6 pct a year earlier.\n    Hahn said VW hoped to sign a contract with Ford Motor Co\n&lt;F.N> in the summer on the planned joint venture between the\ntwo companies' loss-making operations in Argentina and Brazil.\n    A provisional joint management team was already looking at\nways of synchronising the two operations, he said. VW's\noperations in Mexico had made again made a profit in 1986, he\nadded.\n    Hahn, speaking to Reuters in an interview to mark\nproduction of VW's 50 millionth car, said VW had no plans to\nmake acquisitions outside the automotive sector.\n    It also did not expect to raise capital again in the\nforeseeable future after increasing capital by 25 pct in 1986\nin the biggest rights issue in West German history, Hahn said.\n    In a separate interview Karl-Heinz Briam, the management\nboard member responsible for labour relations, said VW did not\ncurrently plan to increase its workforce further this year.\n    All of VW's domestic plants and most of its foreign\nproduction facilities were currently operating at full\ncapacity, Briam said. The exceptions were VW's Nigerian\noperations and its Westmoreland plant in Pennsylvania.\n    Hahn said VW had recently taken steps to increase the\nflexibility and improve the structure of the Westmoreland\nplant. However, VW was not planning to increase production\nthere at the moment.\n    \"Most of the VW vehicles (sold in the U.S.) will, as before,\nbe built in Germany,\" Hahn said.\n    Hahn said there was room for further growth in West\nGermany, and predicted that 1987 would be a good year generally\nfor the industry domestically.\n    Wolfgang Lincke, head of car development at VW, said the\nincreasing environmental awareness of West German consumers\nwould allow VW to sell more \"higher value\" cars in future\ncontaining equipment such as catalytic converters, which cut\nexhaust emissions.\n    Lincke declined to be drawn on when VW may introduce a\nsuccessor to its current Golf model, which in 1983 replaced the\noriginal dating from 1974.\n    VW would in any case retain the Golf name. Of the 50 mln VW\ncars built since VW started commercial production after World\nWar II, nearly nine mln have been Golfs, Lincke said.\n    VW, which traditionally releases its annual results in\nApril or May, said last week 1986 profit and dividend would\nboth be unchanged despite the need to make provision to cover\nthe possible loss of 480 mln marks from allegedly fraudulent\nhedging operations.\n    VW has also said the currency scandal would not affect the\ncompany's investment spending.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "West German bond yields could decline\nover the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize\nexchange rates, as seen in last month's Paris pact, extend to\nkeeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.\n    But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under\nagreements to stimulate West Germany's economy, they said.\n    The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized\ncurrencies with the threat of central bank intervention,\neconomists said.\n    Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster\nthe pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates\nfurther when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April.\n\"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank\nand the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate\nare significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S.\nand foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent\nstudy.\n    It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads\nwas a major factor in the dollar's fall. These spreads will\nhave to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.\n    West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged\nthe U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the\nBundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid\nweakening the dollar.\n    West German economists see room for further cuts in leading\nWest German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.\n    \"It's not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank\nAG said.\n    But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates\nonly in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation\nwill limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.\n    The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already\nnearing last year's low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50\npct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.\n Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to\nshift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move\nwould tend to flatten the yield curve between short and\nlong-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the\nBundesbank lowered its discount rate.\n    It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as\nthe shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow\ngrowth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate.\n    But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West\nGerman tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to\nmeet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may\nforce interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must\nbe filled by higher government borrowing.\n    This may not occur if private sector demand for credit\nremains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.\n    Economists said it appeared the government had already\nstepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from\nother sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than\nexpected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.\n    Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German\nIfo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987\ntax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the\nWest German government in November.\n    Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up.\nBut coupled with other factors such as waning foreign\nspeculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline, long\nterm yields may to have to rise, economists said.\n    Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to\nincreases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package.\n    The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in\n1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.\n    West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased\nborrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.\n    Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he\nwas looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as\nraising indirect taxes.\n    But few economists believe the government will be able to\ngo through with its tax measures without increasing net\nborrowing.\n    The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was\nwrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986\ncould be managed without increasing deficits.\n    The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed\na large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final\nquarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.\n    The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of\nthe fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion\nmarks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it\nhad not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Apart from the French\nplant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West\nGermany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands\nand Denmark.\n    Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the\ninstallations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the\nHaubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes\nsaid.\n    If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and\ndeveloping two other French plants, either in the maize or\nwheat starch sector.\n    Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion\nfor its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its\ncapital increase.\n    Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of\nBeghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,\nhas been holding talks with other European companies on\npossible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be\nintroduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

You can't expect to get very far\nat the first meeting,\" one banker said.\n    The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting\nhere of the Inter-American Development Bank.\n    The most urgent item on yesterday's agenda was the need for\na legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank\ncredit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the\nend of March.\n    Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough\ncredit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs\nto request a formal extension of the commitments to head off\npossible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.\n    The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will\nendorse Brazil's request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or\nsimply relay it without comment.\n    This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday's\nmeeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable\nlanguage for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.\n    Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day\nrollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally\nmatured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15.\nBankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is\nsubject to the moratorium.\n    Once interest on Brazil's debts becomes more than 90 days\noverdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on\nnon-performing basis and may book payments only as and when\nthey are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.\n    Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter\nwould be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis.\nOther U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.\n    Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and\nsaid he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if\nthere was a way round the problem.\n    He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan\nmight be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could\nhappen.\"\n    Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the\ncommittee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with\nBrazil's determination to find a long-term solution to the\nproblem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.\n    Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a\ntime is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans\ncan it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.\n    \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can't\nmeet all its obligations,\" he said.\n    Gros defended Brazil's recent economic record, noting\ninflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the\npublic sector budget was in operational surplus.\n    But he said there was a need to spell out government\npolicy, especially on prices.\n    \"It's necessary to clarify policy for internal and external\nreasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures\nmight be introduced.\n    Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the\nbanks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed\nby the country's creditors.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and\nsenior vice president told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap\nbetween demand and supply will widen so that the trend to\nincreasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is\ninevitable,\" McIvor said.\n    Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are\nnot likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.\n    McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil\nand gas exploration and production said that dependence would\nresult from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when\nthe rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.\n    \"Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25\nbillion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only\nabout 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.\n    \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the\nremaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is\nproducing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.\n    McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered\nso far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained\nabout 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"\n    McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not\nbelieve there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with\nreserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which\nwould change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.\n    \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle\nEast. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20\nyears and only two of these lie outside the middle east\n(Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope).\" McIvor said.\n    McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.\nlike Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a\npeak and would soon begin to decline.\n    But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty\nof opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the\nMiddle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and\nAustralia and Africa.\n    McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those\nareas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher\nprice of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the\ncompanies.\n    \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a\nconstant change in policies,\" McIvor said.\n    McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to\nincrease exploration as these only benefit one part of the\neconomy at the expense of other parts of the economy.\n    Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy\nSecretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he\ncould not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance\nnow but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has\nhighlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the\nneed to increase U.S. production.\"\n    McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a\ngreater role in the future in meeting energy needs.\n    \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an\nincreasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,\"\nMcIvor said.\n    \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation\nfuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an\nindustrial fuel,\" he added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Its\nmajor trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion\ndlrs.\n    If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed by\nFinance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank Governor\nAbdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French export\ncredit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said.\n    An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resume\ninsurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in\n1983.\n    The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of the\ndemands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's\nestimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which\nagreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and a\nsteering committee representing the commercial banks.\n    The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised\nbecause of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate in\nthe agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by senior\nNigerian officials and representatives of the steering\ncommittee.\n    The entire package also is being held up because of the\nneed to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term\ninsured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful that\nan accord will be struck by May 31.\n    The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors'\nclaims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of\nletters of credit contained in the commercial bank\nrescheduling.\n    Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resume\ncover fairly soon as this could encourage other official\ncreditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.\n    Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt\nreschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh\nexport credits this year from official export credit agencies.\n    British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down\nfrom 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, which\ndo not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Under the pact, Tokyo agreed\nto stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to\nincrease its imports of American semiconductors.\n    Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by\nselling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost\nAmerican imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory\naction.\n    In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese\nchip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost\ndomestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.\n    Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit\ndynamic random access and erasable programmable read only\nmemory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a\ncutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the\nyear.\n    He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of\nchips available for export through unregulated distributors in\nthe so-called grey market.\n    \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is\ndiminishing.\"\n    To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI\ncalled in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker,\nNEC Corp &lt;NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing\nspecific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary\nof &lt;Texas Instruments Inc>.\n    Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the\nsteps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for\nU.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.\n    The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George\nSchultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary\nMalcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.\n    The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are\nexpected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker\nMicron Technology Inc &lt;DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in\nHong Kong.\n    Yamamoto admitted that &lt;Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong\nKong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but\ndenied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.\n    \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We\nwill present our rebuttal,\" he said.\n    The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's\nadvice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above\nproduction costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.\n    He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of\nendorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been\ntrapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron\npublicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day\nthey were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who\nhad bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It said that, because of\nthe LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a\nconfirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The report said Latin\nAmerica continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that\nbegan in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up\nto nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.\n    The report said the region's improved economic growth last\nyear was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller\nutilization previously underused production capacity.\n    \"This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and\nbeyond because no significant new investments are being made,\"\nthe report said.\n    The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling\n3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to\n35.44 billion dlrs.\n    Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually\ndisbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.\n    To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed\n1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its\ntotal outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.\n    In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio\nOrtiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank \"will be at a\nsimilar level to last year.\"\n    He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed\nparticularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and\nenvironmental and public health, education and urban\ndevelopment. The annual report was released as the Bank's\nannual meeting is being held in Miami.\n    Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries\nwill discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan\nveto power from the current majority to 35 pct.\n    Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan\nit did not like with the assistance of only one other country.\n    The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new\nfinancing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the\nLatin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration\nto control the agency's critical loans.\n    The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power\nalthough it believes the bank's largest contributors should\nhave greater influence within the institution.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Because its novel financing deal sold\nquickly last week, General Motors Corp's &lt;GM> General Motors\nAcceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings,\nsaid Michael Mangan of GMAC.\n    \"We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to do\nmore,\" said Mangan, director of corporate financing.\n    Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price\nlevels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small\nregional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc\nand PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.\n    \"We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,\"\nMangan said.\n    \"GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their\nthoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the\nsecurities were placed,\" the GMAC officer added.\n    Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different\npricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at\nattractive rates. \"GMAC saved some basis points with this\ntechnique,\" said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.\n    \"Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made\nsense, obviously we would not have done it,\" Mangan noted.\n    The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.\n    For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes,\nthe offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over\ncomparable Treasury securities.\n    Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield\nof 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases\nof more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20\nto yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.\n    In contrast, Ford Motor Co's &lt;F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit\nlast month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to\nyield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.\n    \"Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,\"\nsaid an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk.\n\"They have to buy the securities in the secondary market.\"\n    Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in\nthe secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge\nnumber of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.\n    \"Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their\nholdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them,\" said\none trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors\nwould gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries\nif they could buy debt issues at or below par.\n    \"The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail\ninvestors,\" commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities\nthat were aimed at the retail sector.\n    \"Access to retail investors was the driving force behind\nthe multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to\nspeak,\" Mangan said.\n    \"There is a lot of GMAC paper out there,\" the executive\nadded, referring to the unit's past offerings. \"One of our\nbasic strategies is to target securities to specific investors\nand hopefully attain a broader distribution.\"\n    Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were\nselling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out\nby Friday afternoon.\n    \"In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions,\nyou have to make a lot more telephone calls,\" an investment\nbanker pointed out.\n    Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with\nco-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong\nretail bases. \"They can carve out a niche here,\" one said.\n    \"We plan to underwrite more of these deals,\" said a Korth\nofficial. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.\n    Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on\nWall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm\nunderwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for\nCiticorp &lt;CCI>.\n    GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth in\nOctober 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different\nprice levels.\n    \"But the price gap between the first and second tier was\nlarge,\" Mangan said. In our conversations with the\nunderwriters, we thought three different tiers would make more\nsense because the prices would not be far apart.\"\n    Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bid\ncompetitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refunding\nmortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co &lt;PE>.\nNon-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 by\nMoody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's.\n    Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC>,\nwill hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serial\nequipment trust certificates. The debt is rated a top-flight\nAAA by both Moody's and S and P.\n    IDD Information Services said the 30-day corporate visible\nsupply rose to 3.98 billion dlrs from 3.28 billion dlrs.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He said the\nchanges sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a\ngreater majority of shares than a simple majority.\n    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.\nposition that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.\n    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker\nsaid he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.\ndebt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,\nopen markets and a reduced government role in the economies of\ndebtor nations.\n    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a\nmajor program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor\ncountries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms\nin those areas of their economies.\n    Such reforms would include, among other things, more\nconcern for natural resource management.\n    Baker said this lending should help debtors make a\ntransition to more open economies and freer markets.\n    He also said the bank could double its current lending\nvolume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the\npoorest nations.\n    The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve\nits analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening\nits process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations.\nHe urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker\nsaid, \"We simply believe that more discretion and policy\ninfluence should lie with the parties which contribute the\nlion's share of resources.\"\n    He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the\nReagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB\nand other multilateral development banks.\n    Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the\nbest of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if\nCongress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Others, like the Philippines and Chile, are\nprivatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.\n    The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile,\nhave committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major\ndebtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have\nrescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the\nParis club, while commercial banks are making new loans.\n    Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70\nbillion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile,\nVenezuela and Mexico.\n    Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progress\nindustrial nations are making in promoting moderate global\ngrowth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade\nimbalances.\n    He maintained world economic conditions were \"continuuing to\nimprove\" a development that would provide a positive backdrop\nfor debtor nations.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The company will inform doctors within one\nweek if a patient meets enrollment criteria and whether there\nare sufficient amounts of the drug available.\n    On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the\ndrug for wide clinical use. The drug is not a cure for AIDS,\nbut it does prolong the lives of certain people with AIDS, who\nhave a history of certain types of pneumonia, and patients with\nan advanced form of AIDS-related complex whose immune systems\nhave declined after infection with the virus.\n    The company said it only has enough supply of the drug to\ntreat 15,000 patients and by the end of the year should have\nenough supply to treat 30,000 patients.\n    Dreyer said physicians can call 1-800-843-9388 for\ninformation about distribution of the drug, and pharmacists can\ncall 1-800-322-1887 to place orders for the drug.\n    Dreyer added this distribution system will end once an\nadequate supply of the drug is available.\n    Thomas Kennedy, vice president of corporate affairs,\ndeclined to comment on the cost of developing the drug.\n    Some organizations have criticized the high cost of the\ndrug, which is said to be between 7,000 and 10,000 dlrs per\nyear for treatment. Dreyer said it took seven months to make\nthe drug, and the company obtained the principal raw material\nfrom Pfizer Inc &lt;PFE>.\n    Dryer said the company is developing other suppliers.\n    The company said it spent 80 mln dlrs for the raw materials\nfor the drug and an undisclosed amount on research, but would\nnot disclose the total cost of developing Retrovir.\n    Burroughs has cited the high cost of making the drug as one\nof the reasons for its cost.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But it added that the SEC staff has not yet considered\nthe costs and benefits of the various alternatives.\n    The report does not deal with a second precipitous dip in\nthe market which occurred Jan. 23.\n    On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 115\npoints in little more than an hour.\n    The SEC said its staff was still analyzing the underlying\ncauses of that price decline and had not yet made findings.\n    The SEC study was made after a number of investors, news\nreports and other analysts blamed the Sept. 11-12 drop on\nso-called \"program trading,\" in which computers rapidly execute\ncomplex trading strategies designed to profit from minute\nchanges in the relationship between the price of stock index\nfutures and the stocks that make up the index.\n    The investors and analysts complained that such rapid\nmovements in the stock market would drive small investors out\nof the market and possible even lead to a stock market crash.\n    But the SEC report said the possibility of a market\ncollapse was \"remote.\"\n    It said it believed any rapid stock price decline \"likely\"\nwould eventually be reversed by renewed buying as prices\nreached far lower levels.\n    It also argued that index futures and options are important\nto traders who use them to hedge their market positions and\nlessen risk exposure.\n    \"While a 'cascade effect' may be possible as a result of\nindex-related trading, it did not ocur on Sept. 11 and 12,\" the\nreport concluded.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

It said the motion was filed in\nconnection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending in\nthat court.\n    Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written by\nFarris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late\n1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trial\nbegan.\n    The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosity\nagainst Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller,\ndue to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from the\ncase. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a\n10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief trial\nlawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assigned\nto him, Texaco said.\n    In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grant\nTexaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.\n    Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearing\non the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, and\nthe application will be filed on March 30.\n    The company said it will ask the court to reconsider its\ndecision on the issue of due process in light of the Farris\nletters.\n    In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billion\ndlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil's\nproposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken over\nby Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.\n    A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of the\nletters for some time but were unable to release them until now\ndue to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneys\nfrom which they were secured.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today\nlodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its\npetition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.\n    The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,\nwhen AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed\nby banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the\ncollapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.\nAMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.\n    The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on\nthree points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of\nthe broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.\n    The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to\nwind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association\nwithin the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the\nwinding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an\narbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.\n    The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the\nwinding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will\nargue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold\nsaid.\n    The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an\narbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the\ncourt accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to\nenforce an arbitration ruling.\n    The court originally decided that the winding-up petition\nwent wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT\nspokesman said.\n    The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but\na case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be\nheard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a\nreceiver appointed over the ITC's assets.\n    Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is\npossible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be\nconsolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.\n    Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the\nCouncil's member states and an application by the governments\nto strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner\n(Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.\n    Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin\n\"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the\nnear future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to\nJune 8.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "American Telephone and Telegraph Co is\nanother illustration of a maxim already learned by several\nother huge corporations - that success in one segment of the\nelectronics industry is very difficult to translate into\nsuccess selling computers.\n    ATT is learning the hard way that all the resources and\ntechnological advances in the world can not make up for weak\nmarketing and sluggish responses to one of the most rapidly\nchanging and competitive industries.\n    Consequently, ATT will try again this week to convince the\nworld that it is serious about computers, after four years in\nthe business, by announcing a set of new products and\nshowcasing its latest computer chief, Vittorio Cassoni,\nformerly of ATT's Italian affiliate Ing. C. Olivetti and Co.\n    Industry consultants said ATT will announce a faster\naddition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivity\nproducts, a new version of its Unix software operating system\nand assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.\n    The announcements, however, hold \"minimal significance\" for\nboth ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultant\nJohn McCarthy. \"They are just never going to be a significant\nplayer in this market as long as computers play a subjagated\nrole to the (telephone) network,\" he said.\n    ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984\nand still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States,\nhas only been able to carve out a fractional share of the\ncomputer industry.\n    Last year was particularly disastrous for the company's\ndata systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating loss\nfor the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a\n1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge against\nearnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).\n    Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced its\nwork force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of\n290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computer\ndivision is particularly bad, especially since the computer\nmerged its computer and network sales forces.\n    Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300\npersonal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months of\nthe year after gaining some five pct of the market.\n    \"ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300,\" said\nconsultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. \"There\nwere no major product enhancements last year and a perception\ndeveloped in the marketplace that the product was tired.\"\n    Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressive\ncompetition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on price\nand offered more technologically advanced machines. \"I would\nhave to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum on\nthe pc side,\" said DeWitt.\n    The 3B line of minicomputers has never found great\nacceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system,\nthough loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put a\nserious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted by\nindustry giant International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>.\n    By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying to\ndefuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon or\nsell off the computer division and the company turned over all\nresponsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which its\nowns a 23.5 pct stake.\n    But analysts said the company's image was dealt another\nblow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards,\nwho preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division,\nannounced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, a\nsmall developer of systems to manage networks.\n    Several other executives have also left in recent months,\nincluding John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And,\nalthough the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience\nrunning Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts\nexpressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.\n    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success\nin both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and\nit is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product\nthat does not meet those profitability goals.\n     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that\nit may not give certain products enough time to become\nestablished and customers may be reluctant to buy a product\nthat could be discontinued in a year or two.\n    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative\nview of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two\nyear goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn\naround within five years.\n    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating \"to the\nwomb, going back to our old business\" of long distance\ntelephone systems at the expense of the computer division.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Neither\nof those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's\nofficial.\n    \"It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but\nits not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" said\nDenny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.\n    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the\ncurrent market rumors.\n    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been\nskeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it\nviews fast food chains as customers and does not want to become\na competitor to them.\n    \"I can't put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabody\nanalyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up\nWendy's stock. \"It very well could be someone's interested.\"\n    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time\nfor Wendy's to be sold.\n    \"They're obviously having operational difficulties.

I don't\nthink it's worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyle\nof Smith Barney.\n    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the \"burger\nwars\" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's\n&lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food\nhamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store\nsales last year, analysts said.\n    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced\nbreakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some\nanalysts said the company should be bringing in new products,\nbut it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.\n    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be\nvulnerable to a takeover.\n    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth\n14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has\nimproved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high\npercent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.\n    \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on their\nrestaurants,\" Murren said.\n    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,\nWendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the\nfourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in seven\nquarters,\" he said.\n    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could\nbe going on with Wendy's. \"My gut feeling is something's going\nto happen. I don't know what,\" she said.\n    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs\nper share.\n    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor\nbecause Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead\nof Pepsi.\n    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by\nPepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.\nPepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "Swiss bankers announced a series of\nmeasures aimed at preventing abuses of the country's tight\nbanking secrecy laws as part of a revision of a 10-year-old\nvoluntary code of conduct.\n    The measures follow renewed controversy over the limits of\nSwiss secrecy, prompted by recent allegations that both former\nPhilippine President Ferdinand Marcos and U.S. Officials linked\nwith the arms-for-Iran scandal had accounts here.\n    The Swiss Bankers Association said it wanted to curb the\nright of bank clients to hide their identity behind lawyers.\n    The association said it would insist that banks identify\nanyone doing cash business at the counter worth more than\n100,000 francs, down from a current 500,000.\n    Banks would continue to be required to identify their\nclients in other cases and pledge not actively to help capital\nflight, or tax fraud. They would also still face fines of up to\n10 mln francs in case of abuse.\n    \"The Bankers Association is convinced that this new\nagreement will give the banks an instrument which will\nguarantee banking secrecy and help the standing of Swiss\nbanking both home and abroad,\" the statement said.\n    The code, once approved by member banks, will go into force\non October 1. The original dates from 1977.\n    Controversy surrounding the alleged use and then freezing\nof bank accounts here linked with Marcos and with the U.S.\nArms-for-Iran scandal have again directed attention on the\nrevision of the code.\n    The recent busting of a major international drug ring also\ngave fresh evidence Swiss banks had been used for \"laundering\"\ndrug money.\n    The Banking Commission, responsible for overseeing the\nbanks, said at the end of last year it wanted a drastic\nreduction in clients' ability to hide behind lawyers and\nfiduciary agents, a proposal criticised by lawyers.\n    Steering a middle way, the association said today that\nlawyers doing banking business on behalf of clients would in\nfuture have to pledge they were not doing so merely to preserve\nthe clients' identity nor only for a short period of time.\n    Until now, lawyers have only been obliged to sign a form\npledging that their clients are not misusing their anonymity\nfor illegal purposes.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "Slow progress in talks between Brazil and\nits major foreign creditors has increased the likelihood that\nU.S. banks will declare their loans to Brazil non-performing at\nthe end of the quarter, bankers said.\n    Several banks, citing Brazil's suspension of interest\npayments on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt\nand the absence of a coherent economic plan, have already said\nthey might take such a step, even though it would cost them\ntens of millions of dollars in profits.\n    An inconclusive meeting here March 22 between central bank\ngovernor Francisco Gros and Brazil's bank advisory committee\ncan only have stiffened that resolve.\n    A nasty row is also looming over 16 billion dlrs of trade\nand money-market lines which Brazil froze last month.\n    The legal commitment to maintain these credits runs out on\nMarch 31, and the worried talk at the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank annual meeting here is that some disgruntled\nbank will sue for repayment, raising the specter of a cascade\nof lawsuits and tit-for-tat asset seizures.\n    \"My gut feeling is that common sense will prevail. But is\nthere a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,\" one New\nYork banker commented.\n    Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world's\nlargest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock\nwaves through the financial markets. But no longer.\n    Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in\nthe immediate aftermath of Brazil's payments halt. But, in the\nEurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most\nsensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight\nout of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.\n    In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in\npart or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about\n150 billion dlrs of the region's total foreign debt of 380\nbillion.\n    Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and\nNicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.\n    The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new\nbank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as\nbanks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result,\nexposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for\nthe collapse of a major bank.\n    That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp &lt;CCI>\nfelt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put\nBrazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days\noverdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as\na result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in\n1986 the setback would be manageable.\n    Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a\nprotracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously\nerode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other\ndebtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.\n    Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financing\nagreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, an\naccord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and a\ndeal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring could\nbe reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.\n    In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, the\nbanks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. \"All\nof us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system\n- a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also\nweakens confidence in world financial stability,\" U.S. Treasury\nSecretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.\n    Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalization\nof interest is already happening in practice and that the banks\nought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors on\nlonger-term solutions that recognize that not all the interest\ncan be paid back right away.\n    Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks from\nseriously considering adding interest to the principal of a\nloan because they would have to declare the loan\nnon-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said,\nif the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they might\nbe more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.\n    \"It's not necessarily an unfavorable development,\" Gros\nsaid when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being put\non a cash basis.\n    \"We find more room to discuss these things (innovations)\nwith European banks which have already bitten the bullet.\"\n     What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry and\nfrustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quick\nconcessions.\n    A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Among those most frequently\nplaced on the short list of Shad's possible successors were\nKevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, who\nserved about eight months in the Senate in 1981.\n    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New York\ninvestment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was an\ninterim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) after\nWilliams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy was\nSEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.\n    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may be\nunwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in Vice\nPresident George Bush's presidential campaign.\n    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements for\nShad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.\n    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SEC\nappointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.\n    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose Senate\nBanking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the new\nchairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor \"would be very\nsupportive of the division of enforcement's on-going\ninvestigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would be\nsomeone who did not come directly from the industry.\"\n    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,\nto succeed L. Paul Bremer as the U.S. ambassador to the\nNetherlands.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Bernstein Co Inc said.\n    \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not\nuntil later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference\nsponsored by the investment firm.\n    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product\nintroductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic\nimprovement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.\n    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in\nmid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at\n149-1/2 dlrs.\n    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company\nitself, have highlighted the external economic factors\nhampering IBM's growth.\n    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding\nthe rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and\npointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view.\n\"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said\nof DEC's line of VAX computers.\n    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible\nmid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\"\nwas supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range\nsystems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.\n    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the\nIBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should\nbe unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a\nrebound in its mid-range business.\"\n    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13\npct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth\nin mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.\n    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming\nto the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5\npct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will\ndrop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.\n    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16\npct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin\nsaid. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of\n51.3 billion dlrs.\n    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings\nand stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product\nintroductions in the mid-range area.\n    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to\nDEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were\ncatering largely to existing customer bases, rather than\nstealing market share from one another.\n \n Reuter\n&#3;",

A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy\nmarket,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.\n    \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a\nfour pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency\nfluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to\nmake each contract a larger value.\"\n    As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental\nin the development of currency futures, which now are crucial\nto the Chicago exchange.\n    Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can\napproach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by\ngovernments to control currency fluctuations.\n    \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an\nhour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's\nunrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.\"\n    The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the\nexchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock\nindex futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would\nhelp eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity\nmarkets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day.\n    \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a\nsalutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think\nthis issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change\nin the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to\ngo into effect, he said.\n    Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders\nof the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would\naddress complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.\n    Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring\nbrokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own\naccount. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in\ndual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to\nthe nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.\n    The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect\non the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very\ninstrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said,\npredicting the increase would come within a year.\n    Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said\nthe CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit\non the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could\nnot be a temporary program.\n    The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more\nthan we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission\nmerchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event\nthe price approached the bottom limit.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based\nSouthwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did\nnot know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed\nthat for the year the company should have about the same\nresults as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"\n     He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs\nover \"two plus years\" to set up its network.\n\n    Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln\ndlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order\nto lease its lines.\n     He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic\ntelephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are\noperable.\n     By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's\nsubscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead\nof leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the\nsecond quarter.\n    Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along\nmicroscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more\neconomical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line\nthe diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information\nas a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.\n     \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to\ncarry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland\nsaid.\n    He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.\nlong distance market, with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about\n10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.\n     Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than\nATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone\nexchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the\ncompanies have equal access. He said the company was cutting\nback its advertising by about 30 pct this year.\n     At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total\nnumber of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to\nlast January.\n    \"We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance\nof it,\" he said.\n     Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he\nbelieved ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be\nregulated on pricing plans.\"\n     \"They're so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding\nthat ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition\nin the marketplace.\"\n     \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he\nsaid, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.\"\n    Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's\ntwo owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such\nas the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on\nthem to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.\n     \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and\ntime again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he\nwas \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be\narguing. \"There's no evidence of that,\" he said.\n     He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,\nnumber of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead\nin many areas.\"\n    Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint\ncurrently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in\n90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.\n    \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.\n    He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but\nwas working on it.\n     He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the\nforerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September\n1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone\nnetwork.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

This would help agriculture because some its\ninefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he\nsaid.\n    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the\nprocess, but it should result in a more rational system of\nworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.\n    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a\nrelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26\nbillion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more\nthan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,\nhe said.\n    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in\nthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically\nrealistic...

The companies were in the\nnon-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.\n    But industry analysts said development problems remain and\ncommercial application is still some years away.\n    \"The area clearly has significant applications but it won't\nbe commercially viable for a few years,\" said Thomas Murtha,\ntechnology analyst with James Capel and Co.\n    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could\nbring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can\nbe overcome.\n    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said\nsuperconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,\nelectricity generation and storage, and scientific research.\n    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in\na heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.\n    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T> predicted in an\nin-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth\n150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50\nbillion for those used in electricity generators and 150\nbillion for those used in electricity storage.\n    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable\nof 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered\nmainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of\nsuperconducting material would be needed for such a train.\n    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used\nin nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.\n    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial\napplications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must\nbe cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum\nelectrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,\nwhich is much less expensive, has recently also been used\nsuccessfully, they said.\n    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have\nboosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.\n    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's\nclose, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's &lt;MIMI.T> share\nprice rose 140 yen to 485 yen.\n    In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp &lt;MITM.T>, rose 95\nto 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd &lt;TOMM.T> rose 200 to\n1440 yen, and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260.\n    Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares &lt;URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to\n689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd &lt;FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.\n    Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments\nneeded to conduct the superconductor research also rose.\n    Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor,\nmade from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently\nundergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the\nMinistry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Initially it\ncentred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then\nswitched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.\n    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with\nNorcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which\nreplied that any benefits that could be achieved could also\nresult from normal trading.\n    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise\nin pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover\nthat lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln\n    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a\nmarket capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of\nacquisitions in the next four years has pushed its\ncapitalisation up to around 380 mln.\n    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four\nWilliams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a\nshare. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of\n400.2p a share.\n    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price\ndown to 733p from last night's close at 750p.\n    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or\n0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.\n    There was no immediate response from Norcros.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This was due to the lacklustre performance of\nthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and\nJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.\n    \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in\nstimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant\ngeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international\ntreasury division.\n    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of\neconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to\nboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its\ntrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on\nthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of\nparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a\nsales tax.\n    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance\nof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,\nDai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.\n    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the\nJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress\nwould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

They have not given an exact figure.\n    The officials blamed the deficit on excessive investment in\nfixed assets and consumer demand, a drop in efficiency in state\nfirms, a trade deficit and lower income from import duties.\n    \"China needs a nationwide campaign to increase production\nwhile cutting expenditure,\" the official Peking Review said in\nan editorial yesterday.\n    \"China should institute means for the effective control of\nthe macro-economy and the invigoration of enterprises, larger\nones in particular, by emphasising quality, efficiency and\nreduced consumption,\" it said.\n    Only by such measures, the magazine said, \"can an overall\nsupply-demand balance in society be secured and the economy\ndevelop steadily over a long period.\"\n    A Western diplomat said major factors for the deficit,\nwhich he estimated at up to nine billion yuan, were a drop in\nefficiency and wage rises in state firms, whose profits and\ntaxes account for a substantial part of national revenue.\n    The State Statistical Bureau (SSB) last month said profits\nand taxes of state firms in 1986 fell 0.2 pct from 1985 to\n119.3 billion yuan, while production costs were over budget,\nlosses rose and product quality was unstable.\n    The SSB said profits in most state firms fell because of\nbad management and rapid changes in external conditions.\n    \"For some materials, state firms have to compete on the free\nmarket, where prices are up to double those for materials they\nbuy under fixed quota from the state,\" the diplomat said.\n    \"The firms are not subject to proper market discipline,\nbecause they cannot go bankrupt, do not have to repay bank\nloans and have to employ workers whether or not they need them.\nUnder these conditions, they cannot properly adjust to the\neconomic levers the state is introducing,\" he said.\n    Another diplomat said Wang's major problem is excess demand\nin the economy, caused by wage increases well ahead of\nindustrial growth, and excess growth in capital construction.\n    \"He must dampen this growth through raising taxes or cutting\ngovernment expenditure,\" he said. \"China's economy is inherently\nunstable, either in a high or a trough.\"\n    He said Wang will reaffirm themes repeated by leaders since\nthe start of the year -- thrift, improved efficiency, cutting\ninvestment outside the state plan and reducing consumption to\nbring demand and supply into balance.\n    \"There will be no surprises,\" the diplomat said.\n    The first diplomat said one sign of the thrifty times was\nthe lack of a banquet during a visit he made to a major Chinese\nindustrial city.\n    \"Normally, a foreign guest's visit is a chance for the boys\nto feast on Mao Tai (a strong liquor), turtle and sea slugs,\nwith one banquet given by them and one given in return by me.\nBut there was none on this visit,\" he said.\n    He added economic reforms will slow this year, in\nparticular price changes and the issuing of shares, which raise\nsensitive issues about ownership and ideology. Bond issues\nraise no such dilemmas and will continue, he added.\n    A North American banker, who estimated the deficit at about\neight billion yuan, said economic policy has been affected by a\nnational drive against \"bourgeois liberalism,\" a phrase meaning\nWestern political ideas.\n    \"In China the political system dictates economic policy,\" he\nsaid. \"The large deficit gives the conservatives a stick to beat\nthe reformers and demand more economic austerity.\n    \"One of China's top economic policy makers told me this week\n1987 will be a year of consolidation for his firm, with less\noverseas investment, lower imports and new funding to be\nsourced internally.\"\n    The banker said he is more comfortable about China's\nstability now than two months ago, when the drive was launched\nafter the resignation of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.\n    \"There is no leftist alternative to the reforms,\" he said.\n\"There is no going back to the policy of strict central control.\nBut the reforms will take years. What you have now is a\nconfused mix of control and market economies.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

At year end it held\n145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.\n    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,\nfinding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil\nexploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to\nreserves -- less than depletion during the year.\n    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme\nto double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for\noil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.\n    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and\nproduction volumes but with extra oil exploration and\nencouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.\n    But it called on the goverment to continue fostering\ndomestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.\n    \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when\nexploration is at its lowest level for many years and when\nAustralia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\"\nMassy-Green said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

It showed a loss of 32.03 billion rupiah, against a loss\nof 3.48 billion in 1985, and 1984 profit of 7.25 billion.\n    A bank spokesman told Reuters he believed Bank of America\nin Jakarta was now back on track. \"The worst is behind us.\"\n    Its assets have fallen to 194.07 billion rupiah in 1986\nfrom 293 billion in 1985 and 301.5 billion at the end of 1984.\n    Indonesian profits of the 11 foreign banks allowed to\noperate in Jakarta fell to 6.58 billion rupiah from 39.2\nbillion in 1985, the report said.\n    These profits do not include offshore loans, which are\nhandled through other centres but which account for most of the\nforeign banks' business.\n    Profits of Indonesia's seven key state banks, which account\nfor more than 80 pct of domestic banking assets, rose sharply\nto 319.09 billion rupiah in 1986 from 212.0 billion.\n    Total assets of the seven rose to 40,232 billion from\n31,288 billion rupiah, the report said.\n    Profits of BNI 1946, the largest of the seven, rose to\n63.28 billion rupiah from 35.9 billion in 1985.\n    Its total assets expanded to 12,115 billion from 8,552\nbillion at the end of December 1985.\n    Muna said in the fiscal year starting April 1, budgeted\ngovernment spending will fall in real terms. Many ministries\nhave had budgets cut severely due to declining oil revenues.\n    \"This will naturally have its impact on the banking sector,\"\nMuna stated. \"But I think that with oil around 18 dlrs, the\ngeneral performance of the banking sector will not be too bad.\"\n    Western bankers said the capital market remained sluggish,\nbut Indonesia was using more foreign loans.\n    Bank of Tokyo &lt;BTOK.T>, the only Japanese bank allowed to\noperate here, almost doubled its assets in 1986 to 607 billion\nrupiah from 335 billion in 1985, the report showed. But its\nprofit was barely higher at 8.5 billion from 8.4 billion.\n    Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N> local unit Citibank, previously listed\nas the largest foreign bank, slipped to second place behind\nBank of Tokyo. It recorded a loss of 480 mln rupiah against a\n1985 profit of 11.9 billion.\n    A Citibank spokesman told Reuters the loss was a\nbook-keeping issue and did not represent the true picture, but\ndeclined to give further figures.\n    One western banker said that \"Citibank is still definitely\nthe largest foreign operation in Jakarta, whether or not its\nprofit figures show it.\"\n    Bank of Tokyo and Citibank ranked 10th and 11th in terms of\nassets of all banks in Indonesia.\n    The government allows only 11 foreign banks to conduct full\nbanking operations, and restricts their business to Jakarta.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The facility was\nsubsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.\n    However, the loan was not signed until November 5, and\nbankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have the\nfinancing in place early to give it greater flexibility in\ndrawing the funds over the course of the year.\n    Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowings\nwith a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.\n    At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox,\nadvisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking to\nmake greater use of the international capital markets to reduce\nthe country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.\n    However, bankers believe this will be the country's only\nmajor financing for this year, although another small private\nplacement in Japan could be arranged later in the year.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

This would help agriculture because some its\ninefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he\nsaid.\n    Individual segments in many countries may lose in the\nprocess, but it should result in a more rational system of\nworld-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.\n    It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a\nrelatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26\nbillion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more\nthan that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,\nhe said.\n    Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in\nthe negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically\nrealistic...

This was due to the lacklustre performance of\nthe U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and\nJapanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.\n    \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in\nstimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant\ngeneral manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international\ntreasury division.\n    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of\neconomic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to\nboost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its\ntrade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on\nthe budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of\nparliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a\nsales tax.\n    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance\nof producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,\nDai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.\n    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the\nJapanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress\nwould grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's\nboard and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a\nlimited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.\n    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and\nproblem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for\nblue-chip organisations,\" he said.\n    \"It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing\nindustries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a\nhistorically high yen, and historically low interest rates,\nthere's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"\n    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater\nJapanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln\nyen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17\nto 18 pct, he said.\n    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and\ngain experience with financial instruments which are likely to\nspread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory\nenvironment has delayed (life insurance firms')\ndiversification. Now there's a growing number of new products\nin an environment of increasing competition for performance on\nfund management,\" Smithson said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Others said cooperation between central banks and\ngovernments was easier said than done.\n    Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative\nClayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the\nverge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.\n    \"It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a\ndealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what\nthey want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\"\n    Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for\nthe Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.\n    \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or\nable to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the\nnecessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.\n    It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks\nis not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks\nor even less is expected this year.\"\n    And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987\neconomic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual,\nfall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\"\n    But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in\nforce was not universal.

Most\nwill be taxed at 20 pct, although basic foods, urban transport,\nfuel, pharmaceuticals and probably homes and building materials\nwill be zero-rated. Non-basic services will be taxed at 10 pct.\n    Several other taxes will be abolished when VAT comes in\nnext January 1 and the effect will be to cut producer prices by\nbetween five and 10 pct, MTI said.\n    Consumer prices will rise by about eight pct as result of\ncuts in subsidies, including those on milk and dairy products,\nMTI said. It did not say what effect the VAT would have.\n    Basic changes in company taxation were necessary as varying\ntaxes and subsidies gave a confusing picture, and minor steps\ntaken so far had only improved things temporarily.\n    MTI said inefficient firms were still being maintained at\nthe expense of efficient ones, whose profit incentive was\nblunted by an average profit tax of 80 pct. The idea was to\ngive all ventures equal chances and eliminate distinctions.\n    \"Valid preferences or supports are to be withdrawn, or at\nleast reduced,\" MTI said.\n    The tax changes will be a further step in a recent line of\neconomic reforms designed to boost company efficiency.\n    Management of 75 pct of all state enterprises passed from\nministries to elected enterprise councils in 1985 and 1986, and\na bankruptcy law in force since last September limits the duty\nof the state to save loss-making firms.\n    MTI said yesterday state subsidies to enterprises and\nindustrial cooperatives rose 16 pct last year, while profits\nrose 4.6 pct. It gave no absolute figures.\n    The number of small private ventures rose 4,000 to 39,000\nin 1986. Their turnover rose 27.5 pct and net income 16.2 pct.\nThey now employ 443,000, nine pct of the workforce.\n    Hungarians now pay no tax on their primary income, and\nrelaxation of central economic controls has led to large\ndisparities in earnings, almost entirely in the private sector.\n    MTI said the introduction of personal income tax for all\nworkers would lead to a fairer bearing of the public burden. It\ngave no details of the tax structure except to say that it\nwould be progressive and embrace all legal income.\n    All measures are due to go before parliament this summer.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "The U.S. economy is showing some\npromising signs of accelerated expansion despite the\nsluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private\neconomists say.\n    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December\nperiod had been expected to spill over into the first quarter\nthis year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in\nJanuary slowed business and consumer spending.\n    But some of the latest economic data show signs of\nsurprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some\neconomists remain cautious about the outlook.\n    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for\ndurable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct\nrise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense\ngoods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency\nsaid.\n    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many\nfinancial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to\nincreases of up to five pct.\n    The January/February employment statistics suggest the\nGross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for\nthe first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an\neconomist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,\nthe lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm\njobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in\nJanuary and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.\n    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of\nabout three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.\n    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding\ntheir inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the\nsecond quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the\nsecond quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption\nand government spending. He also sees residential construction\ndeclining mostly for multi-family housing units.\n    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the\nfourth quarter slowness will continue.\n    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the\nfirst quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and\nshow a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.\n    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the\nU.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in\nthe dollar's value over the last year and half.\n    \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy\npredicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at\nleast one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the\nprices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.\n    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,\nwhich soared to record levels last year, will improve this year\nand the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the\nyear compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.\n    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.\nhas been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their\ndomestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.\n    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the\npressure off the United States whose five years of economic\ngrowth has been the mainstay of developing countries.\n    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for\ntheir goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to\nservice their foreign debt.\n    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a\nmodest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.\n    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance\nbetween the volume of goods imported to the United States and\nthose shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of\nexports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact\nthat in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened\nduring the closing three months of 1986.\n    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate\nprofits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the\ngovernment said. It also reported that inflation, as measured\nby the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a\nmoderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.\n    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key\nelement of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in\nFebruary, after falling two pct in January.\n    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the\nmanufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements\nof the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.\n    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the\nFed said that economic activity in the various regions of the\ncountry ranged from uneven or steady to improving.\nManufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most\nregions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.\n    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the\npick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the\ndrop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major\npick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy\nwill slip into recession either.\n    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts\nthat have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze\nconsumers purchasing power.\n    \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of\nyears,\" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around\na modest two pct level for the next few years.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He said further loans would depend on\nthe economic policies Indonesia adopted.\n    But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto\nand leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific\npolicy changes.\n    \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian\ngovernment. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated.\n    Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly\nhit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues\nfrom crude exports in half.\n    Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning\nwith Suharto.\n    He voiced support for measures already taken, including\nSeptember's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to\nderegulate imports and stimulate exports.\n    \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in\na continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of\ntoday's world,\" he said.\n    The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the\npast 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.\n    The World Bank would probably like to see further\ndismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce\nIndonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics\nand cement, western bankers and diplomats said.\n    The government has already said it will announce further\nderegulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also\nconsidering selling off loss-making state companies.\n    Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find\nfunds to cover its share of development projects, which\notherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.\n    She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by\nappointing two Far East bank executives to central bank\nconsultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She\nalso disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts\nfrom January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a\nprofit, not a loss.\n    The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing\nthat Pacific Bank was \"repeatedly given notice of the continuing\nlosses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up\nadditional capital to eliminate insolvency.\"\n    It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank\nof Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase\nPacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed \"because of certain\nlegal impediments.\"\n    The statement said the central bank invited several banks\nto submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was\napproved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.\n    Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had\ndivested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he\nbecame central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman\ndeclined comment on the charges against Fernandez.\n    In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending\nprosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie\nevidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then\nmembers of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far\nEast executives, and ordered their investigation.\n    He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political\nclimate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.\n    \"(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices\nwas either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and\nhis wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens\n... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any\ninstructions from above,\" Gonzalez wrote.\n    Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office\nhad received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He\nsaid among those facing prosecution were five provincial\ngovernors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "&lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on\nexploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in\n1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices\nlast year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.\n    But he told a press conference that due to the high\nmarginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of\nthe drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330\nmln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.\n    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with\nPetroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he\nsaid.\n    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and\nproduction sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.\n    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell\nGroup &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,\nup from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against\n8.81 mln.\n    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil\noutput from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,\nwhich would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the\ncompany. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the\ncurrent year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline\nin output from the major Brent field, he said.\n    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas\nliquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to\nbe maintained in 1987, he said.\n    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey\nNorth Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,\nReid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5\nbillion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil\nprice fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.\n    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North\nSea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the\ncost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.\n    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and\nproduction sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target\nis to keep costs per barrel constant.\n    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to\nthe discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to\ngauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.\n    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a\nprofit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.\n    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell\nU.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987\nwere a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"\n    In November and December in particular, refining operations\nhad shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil\nproduct prices, he said. He expected margins to continue\ngenerally positive over the summer, although they could dip to\nbecome negative from time to time, depending on price\nmovements.\n    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will\nnow come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five\nmonths behind schedule, following a crane accident which\nseverely damaged the plant last year, he said.\n    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from\n11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical\nsite.\n    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which\ncompanies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying\ndevelopment expenditure on certain future oil fields against\nPRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.\n    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in\nthe range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he\nwould expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln\nbpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.\n    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain\noutput was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,\nbut the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will\nfall.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Nippon\nLife will receive 13 pct of Shearson for 538 mln dlrs.\n    Nippon Life's investment in Shearson follows last year's\ninvestment by &lt;Sumitomo Bank Ltd> in &lt;Goldman, Sachs and Co>.\nSumitomo paid 500 mln dlrs for 12.5 pct of the firm.\n    \"There certainly is potential for additional investment or\nfurther linkups with other Japanese financial institutions. I\nthink the pattern has established itself here, and it's\nreasonable to expect further investment down the road,\" said\nPrudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder.\n    Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage\nstocks, resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions.\n    \"The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of\nthe value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to\nbe a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the U.S.,\"\nsaid another analyst.\n    As globalization of the financial markets accelerates,\nJapanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the\nexpertise of the U.S. brokerage industry.\n    Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market\nand Europe has also created a craving for more capital by U.S\nfirms.\n    \"Morgan (Stanley), First Boston, Salomon (Brothers),\nMerrill (Lynch). Those would be the firms more likely to\nconsider hooking up with a Japanese firm, and those would be\nthe ones the Japanese would be most interested in,\" Eckenfelder\nsaid.\n    All of those firms, he said, have been establishing\nthemselves in Japan.\n    While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably,\nthere is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may\nlearn enough from their U.S. partners to ultimately pose the\nsame type of competitive threat they have\nmade in electronics and automobiles.\n    \"The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to\nas markets deregulate. Passive investment is an education\ngathering period. Obviously, there are regulatory barriers\ntoward exercising management control,\" said Samuel Liss, a\nbrokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers.\n    The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approved\nby U.S. regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry. There will\nalso be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson.\n    Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form a\njoint venture company in London to work on investment advisory,\nasset management, and consulting on financing.\n    Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium for\nits stake, but it will also receive warrants for one mln\nAmerican Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson will\nbe cumulative preferred, convertible to common after U.S.\nregulatory approval is granted.\n    American Express has also guaranteed it will retain a\nminimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990.\n    American Express and Nippon are also expected to work\nclosely. For instance, analysts expect it to market the\nAmerican Express card more actively in Japan with the help of\nNippon.\n    \"The key to the deal is not just raising capital for\nShearson, but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon,\" said\nAlan Zimmerman of Kidder, Peabody and Co.\n    American Express stock responded favorably to the\nannouncements, climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today.\n    Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining\na foothold in the U.S. market with the help of American Express\nand Shearson.\n    Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to\nfollow Nippon Life. U.S. insurers have found numerous partners\nthemselves in the brokerage industry.\n    For instance, Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson,\nLufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp, and Prudential Life\nInsurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.\n    Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not be\nlikely acquirors of U.S. firms for the time being, although\nthey have often been rumored suitors in the past. Last year,\nwhen Shearson unsuccessfully courted E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH>,\nJapanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

None of the details contained in\ntoday's negotiations was immediately available.\n    The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can\nbe struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export\ncredit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to\nNigeria.\n    The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in\n1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days,\ngovenment sources said there had not been any discussions on\nnew credits.\n    Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export\ncredits this year from official agencies under a structrual\nadjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to\nsupport a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr\nforeign debt.\n    But these credits cannot be approved until the export\ncredit agencies agree to resume insuring the debts.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Analysts are divided over the\noutcome for last week because there is uncertainty about\nwhether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.\n    Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels\nhigher, while others think inventories could be as much as five\nmln barrels below the previous week.\n    The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude\nruns increased and imports fell.\n    The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week\nended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly\nup or down for the week ended March 20.\n    Expectations for product stockdraws are already being\nreflected in firmer prices, traders said.

        "body": "The move by foreign exchange markets to\ntest the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into\nquestion the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one\nof the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.\n    Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen\nsharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.\n    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and\ndollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to\nsterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of\nrelatively high U.K. Interest rates.\n    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first\ntentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.\n    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar\ndown further in a test of the willingness of central banks to\nintervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene\neffectively, the Paris accord could collapse.\n    \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6\ncollapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.\n    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their\nattention to capital movements whereas previously they had been\nrestricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.\n    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange\ndealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or\neven retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp\ndrop in the U.K. Currency.\n    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.\nPolitical and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and\nrelatively high interest rates, they said.\n    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been\nrunning especially high after last week's budget, seen as\npopular both with the markets and with British voters.\n    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the\nWest German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is\ntrailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.\n    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative\nparty ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also\nsupported the pound.\n    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two\nhalf-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than\ntwo weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the\nnext week or so, has already been largely discounted.\n    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still\nrelatively high compared to other western countries, and\nanalysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely\nto affect sterling.\n    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,\ndropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.\n    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange\nmarkets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond\n(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.\n    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has\nbeen one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.\n    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady\nfor the next few days while the market awaits further\ndevelopments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current\naccount figures for February.\n    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg\nafter January's small surplus.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

ATT's stock was up 1/4 points at\n25-1/8 in heavy trading.\n    The company said it also created a separate 600-member team\nthat will educate the computer sales force and its other sales\ngroups on ATT's computer products. This group, ATT said,\nreports directly to Vittorio Cassoni, senior vice president of\nits computer unit, called the Data Systems division.\n    Cassoni, speaking at a news conference at which ATT\nunveiled its most powerful mid-range computer, said the sales\ngroups will provide a \"sharper focus\" to ATT's computer\nmarketing efforts.\n    The executive, hired from Olivetti to bolster ATT's\nunsuccessful campaign to become a major vendor of computer\ngear, also said the company is committed to its 3B line of\nmid-range computers. He said ATT backed the 3B line despite\nwidespread criticism throughout the industry that it is\ninferior to mid-range systems made by International Business\nMachines Corp &lt;IBM>, Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> and others.\n    Cassoni, however, said ATT would strenghten the 3B line\nwithin the next three or four months. He said ATT will offer\nnew, more powerful mid-range computers that will protect the\ninvestments of existing 3B users in ATT hardware and software.\n    In justifying the company's commitment to the 3B line,\nwhich was originally developed for internal use by ATT and its\nformer Bell telephone company units, Cassoni pointed to several\nrecent sales that he said proved the mid-range line's\ncommercial viability.\n    One example he provided was a recent 34 mln dlr deal ATT\nsigned with the United States Postal Service.\n    Cassoni also said ATT will announce a new personal computer\nbased on the powerful 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp\n&lt;INTC>.\n   Compaq Computer Corp &lt;CPQ> is already selling a 386-based PC\nand IBM is widely expected to announce a 386 machine sometime\nthis year.\n   Cassoni said the Data Systems division is unprofitable and\nthat it will take \"a couple of years\" for the division to meet\nits goal of making a \"substantial contribution to ATT's\nearnings stream.\" But, he added, the division is \"approaching\"\nthe point where it can start making money.\n    Cassoni said the new products introduced today are \"a very\nsignificant step to foster our efforts in the computer\nbusiness.\"\n    Among the new offerings is the 3B2/600 minicomputer, which\nATT said can provide up to four times the processing power of\nthe 3B2/400, previously its biggest computer.\n    But with a top speed of 4.0 mips, or million instructions\nper second, the top-of-line 3B cannot match the computing power\nof rival systems from IBM and DEC.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The shareholders of Illinois\nCooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many\nMidwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote\nWednesday on its possible dissolution.\n    The directors of the company called a special meeting and\nrecommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume\nand increasing costs.\n    Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout\nof Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital\nstock, led to the call for dissolution.\n    The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing\nhouses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional\nand local cooperatives that comprise its membership.\n    Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm\ncooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded\nIllinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.\n    But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer\nDaniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through\na joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.\n    With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade\nfutures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president\nof the co-op.\n    Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a\ncooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A\nnotable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became\naffiliated with Cargill, Inc.\n    Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional\ncooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist,\nof Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries\nin Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and\nHarvest States in Minneapolis.\n    Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative\nFutures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.\n    Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives\nare forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one\ncash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.\n    Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm\ncooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few\nmajor commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.\n    Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the\nNational Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives\nexist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.\n    \"The period we've gone through in the past five years has\nbeen quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of\nconsolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"\n    One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the\nmajor commercials for export, rather than exporting it\nthemselves, losing potential profits.\n    But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the\nmulti-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers\nExport Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make\nfolks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.\n    Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is\napproved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather\nthan a change in U.S. agricultural economics.\n    A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm\n\"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of\nmoney. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\ndoing business.\"\n    \"We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\n\"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\nThere are plenty of capable firms.\"\n    Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing\nwith Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures\nthrough a Chicago-based cooperative.\n    \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to\nindividuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but\nadded, \"The times change and with changing times, come\ndifferent opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"\n    Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had\nnothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you\nthat this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy\norganization.\"\n    In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois\nCooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members'\nequity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for\nthe most recent year has not been filed.\n    Under the cooperative system, income from operations is\nreturned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.\n    Income and refunds in the past five years have been\ndeclining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\nreported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\nmln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,\n1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.\n    \"You're dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan\nsaid. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"\n    According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark\nowns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common\nshares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.\n    Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital\nGrowmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the\nfigure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.\nEquity is distributed according to each member's trading volume\nand, as a result, changes from year to year.\n    However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet\nminimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark\npulled out.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Wainoco said without redemption of\nthe value rights, the company would not have sufficient\nauthorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the\nunits offering.\n    Due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pct\nsubordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is\ncontingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.\n    Wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributed\nto the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remain\nvalid.\n    It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadian\nsubsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset\nall of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its\ndebenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.\n    Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions has\nbeen increased by an amount which should generate savings that\nwill exceed existing deferred income tax liability.\n    Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S.\nare not materially affected, the company said.

He would alert the market via news agencies as to when\nhe wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage\ndesired, delegates said.\n    The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather\nthan choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference\nto ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials\nwould be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to\ndetermine the relative competitiveness of offers of various\ncocoas from different origins, they said.\n    The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a\nmember country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,\nthe delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority\nvote of the ICCO council.\n    Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would\nnot be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they\nsaid.\n    The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per\nday and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,\nintermediate and forward positions, they added.\n    One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is\n\"transparency,\" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's\nmarket activities will be public and he will have as little\ndiscretion as possible, delegates said.\n    After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the\nInternational Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa\ndelegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market\nmechanism, they said.\n     Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to\nbegin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the\napproaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to\nadjourn, delegates said.\n    The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when\nthe new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The\nexisting buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in\nplace with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable\nuntil rules are agreed.\n     Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the\nlast chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,\nproducers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing\nmechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,\ndelegates said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But it was not\nenough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price\nfrom 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.\n    The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher\nthan the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.\nHernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting\nsystem which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining\nand marketing operations.\n    Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from\n323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,\nHernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep\ngasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.\n    Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels\nin reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of\nVenezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's\nproduction capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of\nwhich 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.\n     Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986\nwere 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the\nworld, Hernandez said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "A new agreement covering the repayment\nof part of South Africa's foreign debt represents a compromise\nbetween that country and its commercial bank creditors\nfollowing several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations,\nsenior banking sources said.\n    In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed\nthe agreement a \"good deal\" for both South Africa and the banks.\n    But as one senior banker noted, \"It is probably the best we\ncould hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the\nSouth Africans) didn't want to pay.\"\n    The new agreement will extend for three years the\nstandstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985\nand which was due to expire on June 30.\n    Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will\nreceive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the\narrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.\n    It also will require the repayment over the life of the\nstandstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over\nsix month invervals and depending on the maturity of the\nvarious debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion\ndlrs.\n    Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the\n14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers\nhad argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the\ncountry's trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even\nlarger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had\nbeen speculation that the standstill would be extended for\nthree years, many did not believe that a long term pact would\nbe acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line\nin the negotiations because of America's strong anti-apartheid\npolicies.\n    The agreement reached today differs very little from the\none reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include\none moderation of an option contained in that pact which\nintroduces yet another \"catchphrase\" into the jargon for\nreschedulings.\n    The new agreement contains an \"exit vehicle\" under which\nbanks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the\nprevious agreement banks were only given options for three year\nloans.\n    While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it\ncould offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than\nhalf their investment over the next seven years.\n    To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower\nlooking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate\nindividually the interest rates to be charged.\n    The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan\nwould be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a\nrepayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of\nface value by year seven, one banker said.\n    Bankers suggested that depending on a banks' political and\neconomic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the\noption it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers.\nThey noted that South Africa's Public Investment Commission is\nan active borrower in this area of the market.\n    Today's agreement was reached between South Africa's chief\ndebt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill\nCoordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on\nthe commercial bank technical committee.\n    The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the\ncountry's other 330 bank creditors and that documentation\ncovering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.\n    Because of the banks' sensitivity to South Africa's\napartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with\nFritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank,\nacting as mediator.\n    Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not\ninvolved himself in the negotiations since last year, the\nbankers said.\n    Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal\nto Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time\nthe procedure will be less structured and will be up to the\nindividual banks as to how they wish to handle it.\n    Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the\nSouth Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement\non the repayments took many in the financial community by\nsurprise.\n    A review of South Africa's economy by the technical\ncommittee's economic sub-committee was to be held in February\nwhile the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some\ntime this month or next month.\n    However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity\nwhich surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings\nwere kept secret.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

About 300 other creditor banks\nalso are expected to approve the agreement, he said.\n    Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement\nwas a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks.\n    Speaking at the same news conference, de Kock said the\nthree-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\"\nto South Africa.\n    He said South Africa had negotiated from a \"position of\nbasic economic financial strength.\"\n    \"We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now\nunderborrowed by all international criteria that I've ever\nheard of,\" de Kock said.\n    Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve\nBank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two\nmonths, and a continued current account surplus \"will be\nsufficient\" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.    \nDu Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in\nthe South African economy and country as a whole.\n    He attributed this to \"restoration of law and order which\nhas greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the\nintensity of unrest.\"\n    South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June\n1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over\n2,400 lives in the past three years.\n    Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks\nand South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good\nrelations with its foreign creditors.\n    He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign\ninvestors were again \"taking a more realistic view\" of South\nAfrica. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and\nthe sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.\n    Of the 13 billion dlrs frozen debt 3.5 billion was owed by\npublic sector and 9.5 billion by private industry, du Plessis\nsaid. The remaining 10 billion consists of seven billion owed\nby government agencies and three billion by the private sector.\n Reuter\n&#3;",
