It is a\nhidden, arbitrary and capricious tax,\" Wilson told the House of\nCommons.\n    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian\neconomy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than\nimported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that\nmakes them less competitive, Wilson said.\n     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:\n     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies\nrelated to manufacturers\n     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the\nmanufacturer for a selected range of products\n     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication\nservices, except for residential telephone lines\n     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.\n     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,\nrefundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50\ndlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the\nfinance department said.\n     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new\nsales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added\ntax and a national sales tax that would combine existing\nfederal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the\nHouse of Commons.\n     He said the federal government will explore the\npossibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10\nprovincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a\nprovincial sales of tax of varying amounts.\n     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for\ntaxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.\n     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national\nsales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will\nconsider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.\n     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to\nvirtually all goods and services in Canada and would include\nfurther increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle\nincome Canadians, the finance department said in documents\naccompanying Wilson's speech.\n     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax\nsystems, would also be broad based but would allow more\nflexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the\ndepartment said. The finance deparment said the main drawback\nof a value added tax is that it would be more complex and\ncostly to implement than the other two proposals.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs\nto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.\n    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for\nthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has\nfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,\neconomists said.\n    \"M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,\" said Bill Sullivan\nof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of\neconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned\nthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth\nin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen\nas better gauges of economic growth.\n    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both\nmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's\n5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.\n    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,\nconcerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,\ncould turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.\n    \"Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open\nmarket position? No,\" Sullivan said. \"But does this mean the end\nof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.\"\n    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings\nof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period\nwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had\ntargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.\n    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day\nnet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher\nborrowings target would probably have been reached.\n    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in\nauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,\nwhile a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has\nhelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.\n    \"If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed\neasing at some point,\" he said.\n    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little\nattention to weak money supply growth. \"It has been a number of\nyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the\neconomy,\" one said. \"I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is\nfalling apart and the Fed should ease.\"\n    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a\nprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary\npolicy.\n    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates\nfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and\nhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke\noff econmomic growth.\n    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late\nApril. \"The Fed has to determine if this represents a\nfundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives\nthem more room to ease,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,\ncapitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen\nin government loans to the company for an equity stake.\n    The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic\nCooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24\nbillion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.\n    Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between\n1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen\ndebt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation\nof the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in\ndollars.\n    Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to\nabout 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if\nprices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.\n    Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a\nyear, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,\nsituated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The turnover was more than double\nthe record of 1.1 billion shares worth 118.1 million pesos set\non Wednesday.\n    Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares to\nshoot up three weeks ago, and other sectors followed. Share\nprices continued their rise even when the gold price fell back\nto 450 dlrs an ounce, due to rising confidence in President\nCorazon Aquino's handling of the economy, they said.\n    Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communist\ninsurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates\nalso contributed to the rise.\n    Blue chip stocks, such as those of San Miguel Corp and\nPhilippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT), have risen 25 pct\nin three weeks, and the trend is upward in the medium term\nalthough a temporary correction is overdue, they said.\n    Since the surge began on May 26, Manila's Mining index has\nrisen to 5,700.4 points from 4,042.4, its commercial and\nindustrial index has shot up to 881.0 from 694.9 points, and\nthe oils indicator has increased to 4.1 from 2.9 points.\n    Market activity has been rising in spurts since Ferdinand\nMarcos was replaced by Aquino 16 months ago.\n    One broker said he thought the Philippine stock market \"may\nat last have come of age.\"\n    Wilson Sy, president of Prudential Securities, a local\nstockbroking firm with Hong Kong affiliations, told Reuters,\n\"Barring any unforeseen political events you can bet on the\nPhilippine market. It has shrugged off the communist inroads\ninto Manila.\"\n    Assassins have killed 52 policemen, soldiers and security\nguards in the capital this year.\n    Communist hitmen known as sparrows have claimed they killed\n22 of them.\n    Sy said Philippine stocks were undervalued in world terms\nwith price-earnings ratios often half those in Hong Kong and\none-sixth those in Japan. He said PLDT, which is also U.S.\nListed, has a price-earnings ratio of about nine.\n    Sy predicted Manila's composite index would rise beyond\n1,000 points from its current 775.9 mark by year-end.\n    Other brokers were more cautious, saying Aquino had to\nimprove peace and order before investors could treat the\nPhilippines as they would Hong Kong or Tokyo.\n    One broker said he believed about 30 pct of the money going\ninto stocks was now foreign, much of it from fund managers and\ntheir agents based in Hong Kong and New York.\n    Manila Stock Exchange chairman Robert Coyuito told Reuters,\n\"If the peace and order situation really improved the market\ncould move beyond a price-earnings ratio of 20 times.\"\n    \"But all depends on how Congress performs and the local\nelections go,\" he said.\n    A new two-chamber legislature was elected last month and is\ndue to sit on July 27.

They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary\nreform.\n    \"Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we\nwere led to believe,\" he said.\n    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations\nwhile cutting individual taxes \"is probably an acceptable shift,\"\nsaid Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an\ninternational mining company.\n    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across\nthe corporate sector, James said. \"So it's not going to hit\nanyone too hard and we will remain competitive.\"\n    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that\nCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with\nsweeping reforms in the United States last year.\n    \"The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson\nmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System,\" Manford\nsaid.\n    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations\nby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but\nlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.\n    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to\nlower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many\nspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.\n    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used\nby companies to write off major investments, which some\nbusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.\n    \"That will affect some investment decisions negatively,\" said\nLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association\npresident.\n    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several\ndays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance\nreductions that will be made over a number of years.\n    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they\nintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in\nParliament over the next few months.\n    \"It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab,\" said Liberal leader\nJohn Turner.\n    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax \"a money\nmachine for the minister of finance.\"\n    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include\nadditional products and also promised to introduce a\nbroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.\n    \"It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to\nsee that very quickly,\" New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent\nsaid.\n    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to\nprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that\nwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

An internal\nministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were\nleft too much on their own when making aircraft checks.\n    A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead\nunder JAL supervision, and Transport Ministry inspectors\napproved the repairs without actually seeing them, today's\nreport said.\n    The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because\nthe part repaired had been covered by a seal, the report said.\n    Over time, cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of\nmetal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead.\n    Boeing issued an official statement on September 6, 1985,\nsaying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty.

In May, M-2 money supply plus\ncertificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 10.2\npct, well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct.\n    Some government sources are also worried that the recently\nannounced 6,000 billion yen emergency economic package could\npush up land prices and the construction sector's inflation.\n    Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of\nabout 10 pct in April, but that could accelerate to 20 pct\nlater this year under the impact of the emergency package, one\nsource said.\n    The 6,000 billion yen package was generally well received\nin the U.S., Although U.S. Congressmen and businessmen told\nKondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly, sources\nsaid.\n    The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of\npublic works spending in the package was taking place\nimmediately, they said.\n    U.S. Congressmen were particularly interested in how much\nimpact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade\nimbalance, a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly,\ngiven the many economic uncertainties involved, the sources\nsaid.\n    While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in\nterms of volume, some Congressmen expressed concern that it was\nnot falling fast enough.\n     But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further\nrise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade\nimbalance.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Delivery will be determined in\nthe course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three\nparcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.\n    CPC officials also said the company agreed with the\nEgyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of\nSuez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the\ngovernment selling price.\n    Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through\nC.Itoh.\n    Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light\nfrom Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several\nconstraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels\nand proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.\n    Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where\nlifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC\nthen proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.\n    CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for\ndelivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to\noffload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.\n    CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since\nDecember. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln\ntonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot\nmarket compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary\nreform.\n    \"Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we\nwere led to believe,\" he said.\n    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations\nwhile cutting individual taxes \"is probably an acceptable shift,\"\nsaid Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an\ninternational mining company.\n    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across\nthe corporate sector, James said. \"So it's not going to hit\nanyone too hard and we will remain competitive.\"\n    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that\nCanada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with\nsweeping reforms in the United States last year.\n    \"The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson\nmoved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System,\" Manford\nsaid.\n    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations\nby about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but\nlowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.\n    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to\nlower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many\nspecial tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.\n    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used\nby companies to write off major investments, which some\nbusiness spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.\n    \"That will affect some investment decisions negatively,\" said\nLaurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association\npresident.\n    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several\ndays to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance\nreductions that will be made over a number of years.\n    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they\nintend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in\nParliament over the next few months.\n    \"It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab,\" said Liberal leader\nJohn Turner.\n    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax \"a money\nmachine for the minister of finance.\"\n    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include\nadditional products and also promised to introduce a\nbroad-based, multi-staged sales tax.\n    \"It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to\nsee that very quickly,\" New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent\nsaid.\n    However, economist Manford said Wilson acted wisely to\nprotect lower income Canadians by providing tax credits that\nwill cut 850,000 people from the tax rolls.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers\nfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes\nthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to other\ninterest rates.\n    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in\nyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers\ntrying to lock into cheap money.\n    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials\nsaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home\nmortgage business.\n    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They\nwere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a\nfew years ago.\n    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,\nmostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low\nas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their\nportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to\ninduce them to retain their accounts.\n    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were\nforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose\nrates would move in line with the cost of funds.\n    \"We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,\"\nsaid a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,\nexplaining why his institution, for the time being, is only\noffering variable rate mortgages.\n    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped\nhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders\nconcede they are being forced to undercut each other still\nmore.\n    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier\nthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and by\nNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for\nnew business, officials at all three institutions said.\n    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even\nbelow those on the variable rate loans.\n    \"Of course they are less profitable than other (variable\nrate) mortgages,\" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which\nearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate\nnew mortgage loans.\n    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable\nloans because, \"It was just another way to attract people to our\nmortgage product.\"\n    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed\nrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.\n    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was\nexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.\n    \"Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,\" she said, noting\nthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct\nof its 1986 volume.\n    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they\noffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest\nrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the\nlender is earning an above average return on assets.\n    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won\nthe benefit of cheap money.\n    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed\nrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption\nthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates\nfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.\n    Young explained that the company had planned to protect\nitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a\ncomplicated hedging instrument.\n    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations\nand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He\nsaid money market rates were too high to arrange both the\nmortgages and hedge profitably.\n    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does\nmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This\nmeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond\nand selling them to an investor.\n    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more\nefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate\nmortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular\nagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money\nover the past few years.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

(FECSA), a major utility, defaulted on two\nbillion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year.\n    Secretary of State for the Economy, Guillermo De la Dehesa,\ntold Reuters in an interview that a new government-inspired\ntariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each year\nwould guarantee the long term viability of the industry.\n    He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes\n(parliament) this summer, enabling tariff increases from next\nyear to be set under the new system.\n    De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of the\nscheme, known here as the \"Marco Estable\" (stable framework), but\nsaid future tariff increases would make up for the failure of\npast adjustments to cover rising costs.\n    \"The utility companies have a captive market and if they are\nassured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the best\nof all possible worlds to do business in,\" De la Dehesa said.\n    FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign and\nSpanish bankers who expressed fears that other utility\ncompanies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidence\nin the industry's future is restored.\n    Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts, with\nshort and medium term exposure of 4,377 billion pesetas at the\nend of last year. A significant proportion of it is in foreign\ncurrency, bankers say.\n    The new tariff plan, currently being discussed with\nrepresentatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers,\nwould shortly be presented to foreign creditors, De la Dehesa\nsaid.\n    FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when the\nstock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on the\ngrounds that it could not meet its debts.\n     \"FECSA was a special case,\" De la Dehesa said, \"but the banks\ntook fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utility\nsector. We really did not expect this.\"\n    Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been on\nthe strength of a government commitment made to international\nbankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support the\nindustry.\n    \"I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis of\ndeclarations by our energy authorities in London, they will\nhave all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system is\npassed into law,\" De la Dehesa said.\n     \"This is going to be a palpable fact, not just a\ndeclaration,\" he added.\n    De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence was\nrestored in the sector as a whole, FECSA's debt problems would\nbe quickly solved.\n    A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA's\nforeign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona on\nTuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailing\nutility's debt.\n    FECSA's General Manager, Jose Zaforteza, told Reuters he\nthought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved by\nthe new tariff proposals.\n    \"You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electrical\nutility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to cover\nyour costs,\" Zaforteza said.\n    The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a U.S. Bank\nwhich has lent money to FECSA said there would be little\nsignificant progress in the rescheduling talks until details of\nthe tariff proposals were known.\n    \"We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to pay\nits debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be,\" he\nsaid.\n    \"If you make annual increases over a period of years of\nfour, five or six pct, in each case it's a completely different\nball game,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The tax\nreform does not encompass corporate taxation.\n    The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package\nwould be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances\ncurrently granted to diverse interest groups.\n    A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues\nresulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the\npackage.\n    This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs,\nwhich the government would have to decide how to cover, either\nby raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts.\n    The package favoured by Eyskens, who has described Belgium\nas a \"fiscal Himalaya,\" is the least costly of the 11 scenarios\nprepared. It envisages three marginal rates, or tax thresholds,\nof 30 pct, 40 pct and 50 pct. This compares with 13 currently,\nof which the highest is 71.6 pct.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Earlier this\nyear, Midland Bank Plc pulled out of equity market making\nbecause it did not believe the return justified the costs\ninvolved in maintaining and developing a market share.\n    Lloyds Treasurer Alan Moore subsequently told Reuters that\nthe decision was taken at a board meeting earlier today and had\nbeen under discussion for some time.\n    He said the move was not a reaction to any losses sustained\nin the trading of Eurobonds or gilts but rather a result of a\n\"strategic review\" of the future of Lloyds involvement in these\nmarkets. In the end, Lloyds decided these markets did not\nrepresent \"an attractive return to our shareholders,\" he said.\n    He noted that Lloyds had not expected its U.K. Government\nbond operations would be profitable in the early stages,\nalthough he declined to discuss the finances of the operation.\n    \"This is an overcrowed market,\" Moore said of the U.K.\nGovernment bond market, which began Big Bang with 27 market\nmakers. Lloyds withdrawal now leaves the number at 26.\n    Market participants noted that Lloyds was the only one of\nthe clearing banks which did not buy a jobber (middle man) or\nbroker before Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, the gilt market operated under a\nseparate system which involved separate functions for jobbers\nand brokers. Now these tasks have been taken up by market\nmakers acting as both.\n    Moore said that one reason Lloyds decided to withdraw from\nthese markets was that they could no longer justify the\ncommitment of capital that was required to maintain these\noperations.\n    He said Lloyds would make every effort to redeploy\nemployees in these areas within the bank.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "U.S. crude oil prices are at their\nhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC\nmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any\npolicy changes from the session.\n    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the\norganization's accord in December, have risen on technical\nfactors within the market and concerns about supplies because\nof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the\nGulf.\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading\naround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile\nExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its\nhighest level since January 1986.\n    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's\noil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to\nbe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production\nagreement may only need a slight review.\n    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation\nof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to\na desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.\n    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon\nafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased\ntension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices\nshould begin easing.\n    \"OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed\nto in December because oil prices are firm,\" said John Hill, a\nvice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.\n    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at\n18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to\n16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln\nbarrels in the fourth quarter.\n    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising\nfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.\n    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,\nAlgeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a\nreduction in output.\n    \"And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to\ntrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that\nOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,\" said Nauman\nBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.\n    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such\nas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.\n    \"The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the\nofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are\ncommitted to stabilizing the market,\" said Rosario Ilacqua,\nanalyst with L.F. Rothschild.\n    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting\nin September to re-evaluate market conditions.\n    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the\nfourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a\nday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000\nbarrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president\nof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.\n    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this\nmeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to\noffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated\nthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,\nproducers receive less money for their oil.\n    \"The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,\"\nsaid Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.\n    \"In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to\nproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act\nas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two\ndlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,\" he\nsaid.\n    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.\n    \"The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian\nGulf,\" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache\nSecurites.\n    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been\nregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration\nis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the\nU.S. flag, with naval escorts.\n    \"Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis\nlike this, and just general nervousness over an incident that\ncould disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,\" Knuettel said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The tug-of-war over who pays to develop\nnew weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead\nto more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.\n    Singer Co &lt;SMF> and Northrop Corp &lt;NOC> recently announced\nplanned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major\ndefense programs under fixed-price government contracts.\n    \"It's a case of companies paying for things that in a\ndifferent environment the Defense Department would have paid\nfor,\" said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities\nCorp.\n    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increased\ncompetitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked\ncontractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons\nprograms.\n    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors\nbut have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,\nanalysts said.\n    \"It's a stricter environment,\" said Anthony Hatch of Argus\nResearch Corp. \"Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and\nmore of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to\ncome.\"\n    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, the\nanalysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are the\nAdvanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,\nhigh-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. Air\nForce, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter\nExperimental, LHX, under development for the Army.\n    Other programs may also be affected, they said.\n    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced\nfighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,\nanalysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing for\na contract to develop a prototype ATF.\n    Lockheed Corp &lt;LK>, General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD> and Boeing\nCo &lt;BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp &lt;NOC>\nand McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> on ATF.\n    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are\nBell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc &lt;TXT>, coupled with\nMcDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX>\nSikorsky paired with Boeing.\n    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnell\nDouglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,\nand a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be\nmade by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.\n    Under the government's new procedures, contractors can\nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  \ntypically recoup their investments during production.\n    But now the government sometimes awards production to a\nsecond contractor who did not develop the system. General\nElectric Co &lt;GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine for\nthe Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of\nF404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.\n    Such tactics have increased competition but the government\nnow risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,\nsaid Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.\n    \"Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worst\nenemies. They were not cost efficient,\" LaTronica said. \"Now\nDOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other\nway that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as\na national resource.\"\n    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in\nrecent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products\nthan it imported, he noted.\n    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in\ngovernment procurement may be coming.\n    \"I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,\"\nsaid John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.\n    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe\nthe Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and\nperhaps start paying more development money.\n    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry\ndespite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,\nsaid, \"There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing\npsychology of the last few years is starting to shift.\"\n    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently\nsuggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get\nsole production of the plane for a specified time.\n    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,\nBoeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to\ndevelop the prototype.\n    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is\nthat companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but\ninstead will wait for a second source production award.\n    \"But it may take a company going bust to really change\npeople's thinking,\" LaTronica said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The study advocated reduction of\ncholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.\n    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry\nanalysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug\ntherapy will gain wider acceptance.\n    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of\nSanford C. Bernstein said \"the culture can shift in terms of\ndrug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally\nalter their diets\".\n    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600\nmln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,\nanalysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs\nannually in about next five years.\n    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low\ncholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and\ncolestipol, a drug Upjohn Co &lt;UPJ> has sold since 1977.\n    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say\nthe new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. \"Niacin leads to\ntremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach\nupset,\" Crossen said.\n    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to\n30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. \"It isn't fun\nto take,\" Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks\nrestricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under\n10 mln dlrs a year.\n    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have\nlittle side effects because they target a key factor in the\nbody's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the\nliver.\n   \n    \"Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather\nvariable,\" said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice\npresident at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a\nclear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.\n    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a\ntablet form swallowed once or twice a day.\n    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an\nadvisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this\nyear and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late\nsummer or fall.\n    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for\nregulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,\nSanders said.\n    Warner Lambert Co &lt;WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co &lt;BMY> also\nhave cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,\nbut only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of\ncholesterol inhibitors.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "European coffee roasters and traders\nhave agreed to propose a new formula for calculating\nInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch Coffee\nTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.\n    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European Coffee\nFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.\n    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and\nwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an\nunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current\ncoffee agreement, van Horick said.\n    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the\nICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new\nagreement, van Horick said.\n    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when\nprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in\nBrazil.\n    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and\nproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.\n    \"Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the\nformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal\nleaves it very little to object to,\" van Horick said.\n    \"The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not\nreflect supply and demand reality,\" he said. \"Our formula\nbuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost\neveryone.\"\n    Although full implications of the new formula have still to\nbe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as\nColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly\nhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El\nSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.\n    Because the proposal provides that future quota\ndistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it\nshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing\nso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.\n    \"If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least\na fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the\nSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a\nnew quota formula, \" van Horick said.\n    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.\n    \"Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If\nthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two\nmonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we might\njust get an agreement,\" van Horick added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

They lost a lot of\nmoney in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want\nto cut their losses while they can,\" said Keith Brown, banking\nanalyst at Greenwell Montagu.\n    \"The question now is how many other gilt market makers will\nface a similar fate,\" one senior gilt market maker said.\n    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. \"They are\nthe first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out\nof eurobond market making altogether,\" said a member of the\nAssociation of International Bond Dealers London staff.\n    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds\nhad frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond\noperations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.\n    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearing\nbank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from the\ngilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London\nStock Exchange in October.\n    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L>, the fourth\nlargest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equities\non the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. It\ncontinues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a prepared\nstatement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the\nbank had a \"relatively small position in these two overcrowded\nmarkets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to\nopportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders\ninvestment.\"\n    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term\nsecurities trading, swaps and other treasury products.\n    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the\ndecision was forward looking and followed a \"strategic review\" of\nthe prospects for Lloyds in these markets. \"We decided the\nreturn just was not attractive,\" he said.\n    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board\nthis morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration\nfor some time.\n    He denied that the move was a \"reaction to events in the\ntrading room\" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt\noperations were not profitable in the early stages of the new\nmarket.\n    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds\nMerchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he\nsaid were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.\nFor all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln\nstg. \"Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses,\" Brown\nsaid, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the\nbank's exposure to Latin America.\n    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase\ntheir provisions against bad loans to third world countries\nsince Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its\nprovisions in mid-May.\n    National Westminster Bank Plc &lt;NWBL.L>, the largest of the\nclearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow\nCiticorp's &lt;CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was\nadding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.\n    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America\nafter Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.\n    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore\ndenied that today's action had any connection. \"It is totally\nunrelated,\" he said.\n    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the\nannouncement was made. But market participants were\ndumbfounded.\n    \"We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the\nannouncement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I\nstill have job,\" said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be\nidentified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it\ncould to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other\nparts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these\nmarkets was relatively small, other market participants,\nparticularly in gilts, were unnerved.\n    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes\nduring a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have\nbeen battered by the lack of investor participation, following\nthe June 11 U.K. general election.\n    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a\nreturn of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy\ndemand. These expectations have failed to be met and both\nmarkets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.\n    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was\nexperiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials\nhave never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.\n    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems\nfacing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its\nown team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a\nbroker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.\n    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted\nseparately but now market makers perform both tasks.\n    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed\ndoubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27\nmarket makers, even if turnover increased substantially.\n    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that\nsome of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

We hope this need will not be affected negatively\nby trade legislation.\"\n    Rodriguez said: \"we need to keep the market opens -\nespecially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign\nexchange not only to service the debt but also to continue\nnational development progress.\"\n    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he\ntermed \"protectionist,\" and his aides now are mounting a effort\nto water down some of the objectionable provisions in the\nlegislation.\n    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez\nsaid as yet \"the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.\"\n reuter\n&#3;",

The dealers' decision was sparked\nby a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by the\ngovernment to cover industry's rising costs.\n    Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association of\nAutmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt their\nlivelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because they\ncost too much.\n    \"It is a question of our survival. The price of cars in\nBrazil has reached an insupportable level,\" he said. A GM Opala\nDiplomata, he said, costs 30,000 dlrs in Brazil, while an\nequivalent car in the United States would cost about 10,000\ndlrs.\n    The National Association of Automotive Vehicle\nManufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues for\nanother week, consequences will be serious.\n    Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told Reuters, \"The\nconsequences will first of all be collective holidays then\nlay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation.\"\n    A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about half\nof its 21,000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13.\n    Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2,000 workers a\nmonth's holiday, from July 6, halting production for the\ndomestic market.\n    Carvalho said the industry was working at 3,500 vehicles a\nday, below its 1986 average of 4,700 and capacity of 5,100.\n    During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze, feverish\ndemand far outstripped supply. The industry says it could have\nsold many more cars than it produced, but was constrained by a\nlack of parts.\n    Today the picture is completely different after months of\nraging inflation and demand has all but disappeared.\n    Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct to\nthe cost of the vehicle. He described the taxes as \"the highest\nin the universe and the galaxy.\"\n    Domestic car sales during the first five months of this\nyear slipped to their lowest level for a decade, 241,632 units\ncompared with 382,182 units during the same period last year.\n    On the bright side, exports are booming -- sales abroad in\nMay totalled 242 mln dlrs, a record figure.\n    The motor industry is critical of the government of\nPresident Jose Sarney, which has gained a reputation as an\nindifferent manager of the economy.\n    Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitely\ninvestments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year.\n    Wolfgang Sauer, president of Volkswagen do Brasil, said the\ngovernment had created a crisis of confidence.\n    Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150,000 people.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

A year earlier\nit bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, for\nabout 2.5 billion dlrs.\n    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> has added First Nationwide\nSavings as part of a move into financial services.\n    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated its\ninterest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp &lt;LK> once rumored as a\npossible target.\n    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according to\nanalysts. Ford has about 9.5 billion dlrs of cash and\nsecurities on hand, one analyst said.\n    \"The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry)\nis to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of the\nautomobile sales cycle,\" said analyst Jack Kirnan at Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"One way companies feel they can do it,\nparticularly GM and Chrysler, is by diversifying into\naerospace,\" Kirnan said. Ford has been \"a little bit of a\nlaggard\" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to\nsome investors.\n    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,\nwhen it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.\n    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for\nElectrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay\nfor the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of\n191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.\n    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the\nRichardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying\nAmerican Motors Corp &lt;AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal\nset to close later this year.\n    \"Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a\nyear or more and will absorb a lot of debt,\" Kirnan said,\nmaking them the most heavily leveraged auto company.\n    But other analysts said the relative small size of\nElectrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.\n    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed\nsignificantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln\ndlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.\n    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's\nsales were to the military.\n    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,\nChrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the\nautomobile business.\n    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that\nGulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,\ncomposites and aerodynamic design. \"Those will all be important\ntechnologies for winning in the automobile business in the\n1990s,\" Miller told Reuters. Electrospace should add\nsignificantly to the electronics area, he said.\n    Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by\none-time items and but should recover this year.\n    Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for\nElectrospace.\n    \"They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or\nmore professional people. They also have accounting systems in\nTexas to manage their business with the Defense Department,\" he\nsaid.\n    Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into the\nmilitary market. \"Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed more\nat the commercial market, which is a different kettle of fish,\"\nMiller said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The Air\nForce has called for new bids on that contract, partly because\nof the Toshiba investigation, Pentagon officials said.\n    The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the\ncomputer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding\nbecause of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by\nU.S. import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics.\n    Two days ago, three U.S. senators said they wanted a\ntemporary ban on all U.S. imports of Toshiba Corp products,\nincluding television sets and videotape recorders.\n    Senators Jake Garn of Utah, Richard Shelby of Alabama and\nJohn Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to\na major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer.\n    The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology\ntransfer, and Pentagon officials have told Reuters that some of\nthe state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on\nSoviet attack submarines.\n    The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba\nMachine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one\nyear.\n    The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was\ninvolved in the original technology transfer, providing vital\ncomputer software to be used with the Japanese milling\nequipment.\n    But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen\nsaid that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more\nrecent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The price gyrations have\ncombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented\nvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.\n    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some\nlawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate\ntakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers\nsteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.\n    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign\nexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork\nfor an international securities marketplace in which trading\noccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.\n    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment\nopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce\nU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.\n    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial\ndisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,\neliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to\nspur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's\nreview of hostile corporate takeovers.\n    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton\ninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to\nthe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.\n    In line with the views of other top administration\nofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover\nbattles over new federal regulations.\n    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider\ntrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that\ntopped the agency's enforcement agenda during the\nadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.\n    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with\nRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to\nsignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.\n    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them\nlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that\nfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as the\nagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.\n    The agency is one of the few in the government that\nactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past\nfew years because of fees it charges public companies,\ninvestment banks and other securities firms it regulates.\n    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,\nmeaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the\npresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing\nfor policy differences alone.\n    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same\npolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget request\neach year instead of leaving this to the White House.\n    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins\nto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed\nin large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted\nmarket manipulations by large investment firms.\n    The agency requires public companies and investment\nvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on\ntheir financial condition and to disclose changes in their\ncondition any time they issue new securities.\n    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to\nregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, and\nit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.\n    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial\nmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to\nbecome the nation's 35th president.\n    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served\nfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in\n1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's\nfirst term and was Reagan's director of the Central\nIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Pipelines also\ntransport its own gas to customers.\n    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC\nguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the\nregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for\ngas it has bought but could not sell.\n    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay\ncontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term\ncontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as\ncustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.\n    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that\nTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to\nopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.\n    But Tenneco today said open access \"is one of the steps\nFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC\nis moving the industry through this restructuring now, even\nbefore all transitional problems are solved.\"\n    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure\nunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure\nfor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from\nLouisiana and Texas up to New England.\n    \"We remain convinced that the most critical transitional\nissue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by\nFERC in the near future.\n    \"A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the\nindustry's continued ability to provide its customers with\nreliable natural gas,\" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co\npresident R.C.

The plan would have\nthe effect of converting every eight shares of common stock\ninto just one share.\n    Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for\nfurther delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. Herbert\nEdelman, one of Manville's lawyers, pointed out that many\nthousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments\nand that many victims had already died.\n    He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found\nManville to be insolvent.\n    \"They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that\nnebulous value that may be down the road,\" Edelman said.\n    Common shareholders claim they were not adequately\nrepresented because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland\nrefused requests to divide the equity holders committee into\ntwo separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders and\nthe other preferred stock shareholders.\n    During confirmation hearings of the plan, the equity\ncommittee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing,\nsaying he could not represent both groups.\n    The equity holders committee was then abolished.\n   \n    An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the\ncompany's stock was present at the confirmation hearings.\nHowever, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or\ncross examine witnesses.\n    During today's hearing Paul Gonson, a Washington lawyer\nrepresenting the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Judge\nKnapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders\ndid not have adequate representation.\n    Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the\nNew York law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner and Hellman. \"They\nhave one of the best law firms in town,\" Knapp said.\n\n Reuter\n&#3;",

The\nsecond section index, in contrast to the first, closed at a\nrecord 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17\nof 2,401.71.\n    \"Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic\neconomy are a good bet,\" said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co\nLtd. He said his observation was based on figures showing that\nbusiness activity in Japan is booming.\n    The government said on Friday that department store and\nsupermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,\nwhile orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in\nthe same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expected\nmore such figures, but said many stocks linked to domestic\ndemand remain overpriced.\n    \"They are hard to find, but companies with an attractive\nniche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currency\nmovements, are the best bet,\" said a broker at a foreign\nsecurities house who declined to be identified.\n    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic\nconsumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer price\nindex rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive\nmonth on month increase.\n    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,\nwhich erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising\nprices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.\n    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut\nin Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now\ndied, discouraging investors, brokers said.\n    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer\na downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.\n    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may\nalso firm, brokers said. \"I have never been able to justify this\nbecause it should mean that the cost of importing rises,\" said a\nbroker at Yamaichi Securities Co. \"It just always happens.\"\n    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally\nif the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue\nchip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making\nthem look less attractive, brokers said.\n    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the\nmarket index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp\ndown rising capital outflows into dollar investments from\nJapan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.\n    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the\nbalance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower\ndollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand\nfor American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers\nsaid.\n    \"If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a\nfew exporters,\" said one foreign broker.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

At present, the\npresident is chosen through an electoral college system which\nthe opposition says is stacked in favour of the DJP.\n    Among other major changes, the package offers a release of\nmost political prisoners, a guarantee of human rights and a\nfree press.\n    Kim Young-sam, head of the opposition Reunification\nDemocratic Party, said, \"I wholeheartedly welcome Chairman Roh's\nannouncement, though it was a belated measure.\"\n    A Western diplomat told Reuters \"It's a very substantial,\nvery courageous move.\"\n    The second surprise in Roh's proposals was an amnesty for\nleading dissident Kim Dae-jung, who has been banned from\npolitics because of a suspended sentence for sedition charges.\n    The only opposition demand which is not met by Roh's\npackage is the RDP's insistence that Chun should step down\nimmediately.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and\nwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.\n    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of\n16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and\nretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord\nbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.\n    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and\nit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter\nceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth\nquarter.\n    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore\nfields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from\nplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained\nwithin its December accord on output and prices.\n    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around\n840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln\nbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.\n    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since\nFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.\n    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for\na meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement\non the latest oil production cutbacks.\n    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC\nproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia\nand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep\nprices stable.\n    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an\nOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around\n18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.\n    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export\nearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price\nduring the first half of 1986.\n    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some\nstability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade\ndeficit.\n     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently\nrefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to\nthe producing oil companies to set the levels of production.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The lowest paid\nnow earn about 100 dollars (60 U.S. Dlrs).\n    \"Inflation is hitting hardest those in the low income\nbracket which demands that any economic recovery programme\nshould be biased in their favour,\" the union body said.\n    It added that the promised price freeze was \"bolting the\nstable door when in fact the horse is gone\" because prices of\nmost basic commodities had already risen phenomenally.\n    Both unions and business hope that the freeze heralds a\nreturn to wage bargaining between workers and employers, rather\nthan government-regulated pay awards.\n    Zimbabwe has, since 1980, set annual minimum wages for\ndifferent sectors of the economy and awarded wage and salary\nincrements on a sliding scale which gave higher increases to\nthe lowest paid.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

Bond yields have dropped sharply,\nwhile land prices in Tokyo have soared.\n    The excessive speculation means the markets are\nincreasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more\nvulnerable, one central bank source said.\n    A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what\nlittle confidence they have in the economy after the\nyen-induced recession of the past year, private economists\nsaid.\n    Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profits\nthrough financial dealings than from their basic businesses,\nthey said.\n    \"There seems to be an accelerated demand for money to\nsupport transactions in shares, bonds, land and other existing\nassets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on\nGNP,\" the Bank of Japan said in its report.\n    The increased inclination of investors to seek capital\ngains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets\ncould have dangerous implications for the economy, it added.\n    In the Bank's view, a major reason behind skyrocketing\nprices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the\nmarket that interest rates were heading inexorably lower.\n    Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by\nexcessive liquidity, the Central Bank's board recently decided\nit had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further\ndiscount rate cut was not in the offing, one source said.\n    But the bank had to do that without tightening monetary\npolicy and running the risk of a market collapse.\n    This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interest\nrates, which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to\na change in market expectations.\n    While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy, a\nsenior source welcomed the change in market expectations.\n    The source acknowledged the shift may have been caused\npartly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit\nlending in the July/September period. Faster than expected\neconomic growth and a strong dollar also played a part.\n    In the longer run, the Central Bank is counting on a\ngradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the\nfinancial markets into productive areas like capital spending,\none Bank of Japan economist said.\n    But while it waits for that to occur over the next six\nmonths, it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary\npolicy that could collapse the market and lead to recession.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

But his argument has been undercut by reports that the\n1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than\nexpected.\n    That means the government should have more than enough\nmoney in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the\nplanned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax\nmeasures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.\n    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the\nabolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising\nrevenue to offset the tax cuts.\n    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of\nan indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to\ngain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on\nsmall savings.\n    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed\nfrom increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as\nprices of both shares and land soared, one official said.\n    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than\nexpected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year\ninduced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.\n    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be\nreleased by the Finance Ministry on July 1.\n    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut\nattempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce\ninvestment spending by government departments in the 1988/89\nbudget, several officials said.\n    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to\nstick with its so-called \"minus-ceiling\" policy, which calls for\ngovernment departments to reduce investment spending by five\npct a year.\n    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the\nsharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic\nand U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

It did not detail how the foreign\nexchange dealers may have profitted.\n    It concluded: \"The nature, scope and technical construction\nof the deals ... Suggest a targeted and professionally executed\nmanipulation to the detriment of VW.\"\n    The head of the finance department, Rolf Selowsky, resigned\ndays after the scandal broke in March. He is not accused of any\nwrongdoing, but auditors concluded he had \"not applied the\nnecessary diligence in all instances.\"\n    Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested.\n    But even VW admits that the report, published last week,\nrevealed important company failings.\n    Peter Frerk, who has temporarily taken over Selowsky's\nreponsibilities, said the findings were \"not a first class\nacquittal.\" The currency swindle was a \"lamentable event for our\ncompany,\" he told journalists.\n    The auditors said the remaining members of VW's management\nboard and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled their\nobligations, a verdict which almost certainly means that major\nWest German banks, who vote on behalf of large numbers of\nshareholders, will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting.\n    Many market analysts, especially in London, do not believe\na sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a major\nreassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report.\n    The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday, up 11 pct from a\nweek earlier. Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting,\nand one London broker said \"I'm not sure it's much of a bargain.\"\nMost brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy at\nthese levels.\n    Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 group\nnet profit of 582 mln marks this year, and one broker in London\nsaid the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pct\ndown.\n    VW is expected to fare very well both in its home market\nand in Europe. But sales have fallen sharply in the U.S and\nBrazil, where the latest price freeze could exacerbate results\neven further.\n    The company hopes to benefit in the long term from its\ntakeover of the Spanish company SEAT, but this subsidiary is\nstill producing losses.\n    VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-up\ntrucks with Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T> at an under-utilised\nplant in Hanover, but analysts noted production here was only\nexpected to take off fully in 1990.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "OPEC's weekend decision to cut planned\noil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market\nconfidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year\nand boosted international spot prices, oil traders said.\n    Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel\nhigher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and\ncould continue their rise in the next few weeks, they said.\n    The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC\nministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output\nceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd).\n    At its previous meeting in December, OPEC set a provisional\n16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a\nsharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back\nup its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.\n    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was\ncontemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spot\nprices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's Brent\nBlend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.\n    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this\nmorning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35\ndlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.\n    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly\nto news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies\nlater in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onset\nof the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spot\nprices.\n    \"There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth\nquarters of this year\" one trader said. \"In the past three months\nwe have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from the\nU.S., And I expect to see even higher prices\" he added.\n    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson\nin London, agreed.\n    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious\nin setting the new output ceilings. \"There is now a great chance\nthat Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next\nmonth,\" he said.\n    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,\nsaid over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas\nIntermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the\nyear from just over 20 dlrs now.\n    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of\n80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brent\nhas held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.\n    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by some\nOPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.\n    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement\nbecause other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand\nfor the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.\n    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd above\nits assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further\n500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in\nSeptember.\n    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa\nal-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be\nwell above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

        "body": "In the fast paced personal computer\nindustry, millions can be made in six months, and such an\nopportunity may exist now for companies seeking to capitalize\non the delay of a new IBM software standard.\n    When International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> announced\nits new generation of personal computers, the PS/2 family, in\nApril, it also decided to establish a new operating system for\nthe machines, a death sentence for the billions of dollars of\nsoftware now in use on the existing system.\n    Because IBM is the world's largest computer company - some\n70 pct of the world's computers bear the IBM logo - most\nindustry analysts, and even IBM's competitors, expect that\nwithin two years the new operating system, called OS/2, will be\nas commonplace as the current standard, MS-DOS, is now.\n    \"By 1989, at least one half to 60 pct of all personal\ncomputers will be sold with OS/2,\" predicted George Colony,\npresident of the consulting firm Forrester Research Inc.\n    But until then there is an opportunity, some analysts said,\nfor firms selling advanced versions of MS-DOS, specialised\nmulti-tasking software packages and Unix, an alternative to\nMS-DOS developed by American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T>\nthat has developed a following among engineers and the federal\ngovernment.\n    OS-2, which IBM is developing with Microsoft Corp, the\nauthor of MS-DOS, will not be ready for another six months. IBM\nsaid last week that the product is on schedule but analysts and\nother software developers are skeptical, since delays in major\nnew software products are commonplace.\n    Initial acceptance of the new system will most likely be\nhindered by the disgruntlement of hardware and software vendors\nalike, who would prefer to keep making products that work with\ntried and true MS-DOS, according to Paul Cubbage, software\nanalyst with the market research firm Dataquest Inc.\n    Compaq, IBM's major personal computer competitor, has\nalready said it will stick with the MS-DOS standard. Compaq\npresident Rod Canion said recently their will be no \"automatic\nmass migration\" to OS/2. \"(Advanced MS-DOS) applications will\ncontinue to meet a far broader set of users needs than OS/2\nwill supply long after it becomes available,\" he said.\n    Cubbage acknowledged that \"it will probably be a year or\nmore before any really useful applications are available for\nOS-2,\" creating opportunities for multi-tasking programs. \"But\nthere comes a time when the memory limits of those gets to\nyou,\" he said.\n    IBM's new operating system was as big an event to the\ncomputer industry as the PS-2 announcement itself. The new\ncomputers, the most powerful of which will use Intel Corp's\nfast 80386 microprocessor, are expected to rejuvenate the\nsagging sales of the personal computer industry and already\ngave a big boost to IBM.\n    Company officials said last week that 250,000 PS/2s were\nshipped in the 2-1/2 months since their introduction and IBM\nexpect record pc sales ths year as a result.\n    The enthusiasm for the PS-2 is particularly striking since\nthe full potential of the powerful computers cannot be tapped\nuntil a new operating system or other high level software is\navailable, analysts said.\n    OS-2 will allow users to work on many different programs,\nor tasks, at once on a personal computer, ideally without any\nslowdown in operation, a capability the industry has long\nstrived for.\n    Microsoft is already promising alternatives to OS-2, in\nparticular an advanced version of its Windows multitasking\nprogram, which is used in conjunction with MS-DOS.\n    Microsoft chairman Bill Gates has suggested an advanced\nversion of the program, Windows 386, will be announced in\nSeptember and available six to eight weeks later, at a price of\n100 dlrs and 300 dlrs. OS/2 is expected to cost 325 dlrs.\n\n    Some software developers have said the the program,\ndesigned for 80386-based personal computers, may even be\nsuperior to OS/2 in allowing users to multitask applications\nwithout disruption.\n     But several analysts commented that what users really want\nis a multi-taksing operating system for 80386-based personal\ncomputers, and so far that desire has been met primarily by a\nsmall Atlanta software publisher, The Software Link Inc. In\nlate spring the company announced PC-MOS/386, a multi-tasking,\nmultiuser operating system that is compatible with MS/DOS and\nworks on 80386-based computers.\n    The company said it filled 2,500 orders in the first four\nweeks of availability and expects shipments to reach 40,000 by\nyear end.\n    International Data Corp analyst Will Zachmann said Unix\ncould be the most promising alternative to OS/2, even once the\nIVM system is available.\n    IBM did not endorse Unix for any of its PS/2 models,\nalthough it did say that it would announce a version of its\nAdvanced Interactive Executive (AIX), a Unix compatible\noperating system.\n    But the federal government requires Unix compatability for\nmost of its computer contracts, it is almost certain that other\ncompanies will provide Unix-style operating systems for the IBM\nsystems.\n    ATT itself two weeks ago introduced a version of Unix that\nis compatible with the 80386 microprocessor, although not IBM's\ncomputer specifically.\n    Analysts saw the announcement as a move to get Unix\naccepted as a strong alternative to OS/2 before the IBM system\nhas a chance to take off.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

He said Gossnab was hoarding 27 billion\nroubles worth of raw materials and semi-finished products of\nenterprises. He said Gossnab should help expand wholesale\ntrade.\n    Ryzhkov said improved economic management of consumer goods\nand services was required to stem increasing speculation and\nthe growth of the black market economy. He called for a 10 fold\nincrease in the number of cooperatives to help in this field.\n    He said the price system needed radical revision to\naccurately reflect supply and demand, with the state setting\nprices only for \"products of national importance\" in changes to\nbe fully in place by the next five year plan beginning in 1991.\n    The practice of using credit to cover losses must also\nstop. Outstanding debts to the state had reached 40 billion\nroubles.\n    He said there were proposals to replace the \"cumbersome\"\nbanking system with six new banks -- a state bank and banks for\nforeign economic relations, agro-industry, construction,\nhousing and commercial services, and credit.\n    Ryzhkov said guarantees should be built into the law to\nprevent \"the distortion of the rights of enterprises.\" But\nnon-profitable enterprises would be declared bankrupt if\nefforts to make them self-supporting failed.\n    Bemoaning the \"economic illiteracy\" of many managers, he\ncalled for the retraining of economic personnel.\n    Ryzhkov said an immense amount of work lay ahead and \"doing\nit on the go\" would be difficult, but added, \"We do not have time\nto stop and ponder.\"\n    He said the changes should \"give a new image to socialism.\"\n REUTER\n&#3;",

The current account surplus rose 9.8 pct\nto 33.7 billion marks.\n    West Germany reported a 1986 current account surplus of 77\nbillion marks and a trade surplus of 113 billion marks.\n    Economists had expected the rise of the mark from year-ago\nlevels to have started biting more strongly into the nominal\nsurpluses.\n    The real surpluses are already declining. The Statistics\nOffice said after cheaper import prices were taken into\nconsideration, West Germany's imports by volume rose by more\nthan three pct in the first five months.\n    Exports had risen by only about one pct in real terms. The\ngovernment has pointed to this stronger real rise in imports\nthan exports when rejecting international pressure to boost\ndomestic consumption.\n    The Statistics Office said West Germany's trade surplus had\nrisen in May to 10.6 billion marks, from 8.9 billion in April\nand 8.1 billion in May last year.\n    The current account surplus had risen to 7.5 billion marks\nin May from 6.1 billion in April and 6.3 billion marks a year\nearlier.\n    Exports rose strongly from the year-ago month by 6.6 pct to\n43.31 billion marks, while May imports of 32.76 billion marks\nhad risen only 0.8 pct in the year.\n    The Ifo economic research institute in Munich said in a\nstudy published today that the trade surplus would probably\nonly fall to around 101 billion marks this year, compared with\nthe 113 billion mark 1986 record.\n    It predicted a fall in the current account surplus to 61\nbillion marks from 77 billion.\n    Ifo said this reduction would only be \"a small step on the\nway to reducing imbalances in the world economy.\"\n    Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank AG, predicted\na 1987 trade surplus of 100 billion marks. He saw a slightly\nhigher current account surplus than Ifo of possibly 65 billion\nmarks.\n    Helmut Henschel, with Westdeutsche Landesbank, put the 1987\ntrade surplus at 95 billion marks and the current account\nsurplus at 60 billion marks.\n    He said the strong rise in exports in May from the year-ago\nperiod was surprising but it probably reflected calendar\nfactors.\n REUTER\n&#3;",

He's not\ngoing to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we\ncan't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact\nwill be delivered,\" he emphasized.\n    \"We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a\ncontract, so that if the president agrees to something, he can\ndepend on its coming through.\"\n    After returning to the United States from the economic\nsummit in Venice earlier this month, President Reagan revived\nan earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform, calling for\na constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the\npower -- called a \"line-item veto\" -- to block individual items\nin congressional spending bills.\n    At the Venice summit, U.S. trading partners called on\nWashington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global\ntrade imbalances.\n   \n    Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that U.S.\ntrading partners \"have to have faith and trust in the ability of\nthe United tates to deal with its problems.\"\n    He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year\n\"is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit.

However, \"There is the threat that the\nIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,\nwill go for softer targets,\" one diplomat said.\n    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar\nHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was\n\"moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.\"\n    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10\nwarships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to\npatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting\nKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered\nto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.\n    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by\nIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.\n    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by\nChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is\npreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.\n    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to\nmake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.\n    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a\nlaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the\nFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.\n    \"But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti\nterritory would be a very serious escalation\" likely moving\nworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.\n    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying\nout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.\n    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted\nlast Friday \"a river of blood\" throughout the world in the event\nof any U.S. strike against Iran.\n    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused\nof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable\ncapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.\n    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that\nmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to\npro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential\ntrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.\n    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or\nother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.\n    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining\nwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal\ntender offer.\n    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was\ndropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.\n    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,\nthe SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply\nwith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.\n    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it\nbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and\nquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

If the bigger boys' price\ncomes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too.\"\n    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage\nhouses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'\nbusinesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open\ncompetition.\n    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed \"Little Bang,\" will\nallow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions\nto set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.\n    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own\nsecurities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a\nCanadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100\npct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently\nown no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.\n    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by\nJune 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by\nforeign and domestic financial giants.\n    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a\nswirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation\nfever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to\nfour times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,\nanalysts said.\n    \"I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower\ntheir asking prices,\" said financial services analyst Jeff\nCarney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated\ntalks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.\n    \"I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch\naway from Burns Fry,\" added Carney. \"It is just a lot of money.\nWhen your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult\nto pay that amount of cash.\"\n    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was\nuncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were\nissued and approved only in mid-June.\n    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have\nfocused their deregulation strategy on planning their own\nCanadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock\nExchange, Canada's largest equities market.\n    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.\nLtd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.\nrecently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United\nStates investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs\nand Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.\n    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms\ninclude agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.\nto raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10\npct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a\nminority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.\n    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign\nacquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become\nfamiliar with Canada.\n    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to\ncompete in the increasingly global securities market, industry\nofficials said.\n    \"That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change\nwill throw off one or two Canadian global firms,\" Toronto Stock\nExchange president Pearce Bunting told Reuters recently.\n    Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed\ncautiously into the securities field.\n    Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the\nbanks are coping with Brazilian loan problems. Banks will also\nfind it tough to merge their cautious, bureaucratic culture\nwith that of leaner, more free-wheeling securities dealers,\nthey said.\n    While the banks have been approached by securities firms\nseeking merger partners, they have not yet bought into\nbrokerages, choosing to build securities units from within.\n    Last week, Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest\nbank, ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc.\nafter several months of negotiations.\n    But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally\nacquires an existing firm, \"all the other banks will jump in.\n    \"They don't want to be perceived as missing out on\nsomething,\" said Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. analyst\nAlbert Thompson, who believes that brokerages are too expensive\na risk for banks.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But once they\nstart, the Japanese are likely to become very big players,\nopening up lucrative business opportunities, he said.\n    U.S. investment banking sources said the slow start is\nunderstandable because U.S. institutional investors, too, are\nfairly new to the market.\n   \n    Futures markets have a long history in the U.S., but\nbecause of the high risks involved American pension funds and\nmutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until\nrelatively recently, a U.S. investment bank futures analyst\nsaid.\n    In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures,\nan insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed\nfor the slow start, the Japanese sources said.\n   \n    Japan is liberalizing its financial markets, but domestic\nfinancial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers\nin Japan for overseas futures markets.\n    This may change next year, when bankers speculate that\nsecurities houses will be permitted to enter this line of\nbusiness.\n    While the Japanese are out of the business, the Americans\nhave moved in, with First Boston Corp, Salomon Brothers Inc,\nGoldman, Sachs and Co, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and\nPainWebber Inc leading the charge, they said.\n   \n    In the U.S., Nikko Securities Co International Inc is\npreparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of\nTrade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for\nfutures products, Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said.\n    Nomura, Japan's largest securities house, has not yet\ndecided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the\nU.S. to establish closer links between Japanese investors and\nthe U.S. futures markets, Kane said.\n    The evening session of CBT, inaugurated recently to\ncoincide with early Tokyo business hours, has increased\nJapanese participation to some extent, but the brokerage issue\nis still a hurdle, the Japanese sources said.\n   \n    High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures\nmarket, so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime\ntrading session in Chicago if possible, they said.\n    The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and\nestablishing channels to pay fees and margins, but harmonizing\nclerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and\nChicago are proving to be a burden, the sources said.\n    Some Japanese banks, which are largely barred from the\nsecurities industry in Japan, have contemplated buying into the\nU.S. brokerage business, the Japanese sources said.\n    \n    One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions,\nwhich was also a spur for U.S. commercial banks to get into the\nbrokerage business, they said.\n    \"The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or\nto go into a business tie-up,\" said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda\nTrust and Banking Co Ltd in New York.\n    One trust bank source said total fees could amount to\naround one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets\nfully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets.\n    Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively\nmany foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth\ncapital assets, but the futures brokerage business to be a\ndifferent story, Japanese banking sources said.\n    They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to\ndifficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers.\n    In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future, some U.S.\nbrokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13\ndlrs per contract, below the break-even level, they said.\n    Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to\napproach Japanese financial institutions about possible\ntie-ups, a futures indusry source in Chicago said.\n    But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small\ncapital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese\nnervous about a capital link.\n    Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage\nbusiness once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts\ngrowing fast and proves to be profitable, they said.\n    But the big question, they added, is whether the Japanese\ngovernment would let banks engage in this new risky business.\n reuter\n&#3;",

They would effective after a final\nassessment of the area's pollution, expected late this year or\nearly next.\n    For Cleveland, the EPA also proposed a restriction on\nfederal highway funding and clean-air grants because the state\nof Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb car\npollutions as required by the Clean AirAct.\n    Thomas said:\n    \"It is clear that the state implementation plans for these\nareas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxide\nstandards under the deadline mandated by Congress.

Land\nrights activists see no progress at all and say things are\nactually worsening. Over the last year economic pressures have\nforced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners.\n    Land reform, one of the country's most hotly-debated\npolitical issues, is particularly to the fore this year as a\nConstituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution.\n    Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does\nnot give fresh hope for the country's 4.5 mln landless\nfamilies, there will be wave upon wave of land occupations.\n    \"We make no secret of our tactics,\" said one leader of the\nland reform movement, Joao Pedro. \"The solution is to occupy --\nthat is what we say to the rural workers. There has not been a\nsingle program of land reform in the world without the people\noccupying land.\"\n    The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato\nGrosso. Some 278 people died in land disputes last year,\naccording to the Pastoral Commission for Land, which is linked\nto the Roman Catholic Church.\n    The land reform program, announced in 1985 soon after the\ncivilian government of President Jose Sarney took power, aimed\nto resettle 1,4 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up\nthe country's vast, undeveloped estates.\n    The government, in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform,\ndescribed the program as \"one of its absolute priorities.\"\n    In practice, fewer than 20,000 families have been helped so\nfar and the government admits that it will not get anywhere\nnear the original target.\n    Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was\nnow slower under Sarney than it had been under the military\ngovernment of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85).\n    The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep\nfrustration. Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in\nSao Paulo and other parts of the country.\n    Activists say social conditions in the countryside, far\nfrom improving, have significantly deteriorated.\n    Pedro, a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers,\nsaid that over the last 12 months 100,000 small producers had\nbeen forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states.\n    He said the exodus had been caused first by the\ngovernment's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan, which last year froze\nprices and hit the income of small farmers.\n    When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year, prices and\ninterest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay\ndebts taken out during the price freeze.\n    Pedro said most of the 100,000 families who had left the\ncountryside in the south had previously been land-owners, while\na minority had been tenant farmers. Most had moved to Brazil's\nswollen cities.\n    One activist said the number of landless day labourers\ncalled \"boias-frias\" (literally \"cold meals\"), most of whom cut\nsugar cane, had increased to 400,000 in Sao Paulo state from\nabout 300,000 five years ago.\n    In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor, the\nland reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it\nis sending to the Constituent Assembly.\n    The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum\npermissible holding and the land rights movement does not\nexpect it to be voted into the constitution.\n    Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is\ncomposed of big land-owners. He added that the assembly would\nprobably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection\nwould be the signal for large-scale land invasions.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

        "body": "The Securities and Exchange\nCommission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and\nPennzoil Co &lt;PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion\ndlr legal saga, some analysts said.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would file a \"friend of the\ncourt\" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the\ncase. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since\nthey said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the\nrule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas\ncourts.\n    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four\nto 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the\nSEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request\nfor a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been\npreviously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC\nbrief but it did not know whether the brief would support the\nview of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for\nclarification of the reasons for two lower state court\ndecisions.\n    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme\nCourt to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.\n    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a\ntender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an\nalleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.\n    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those\nmaking the offer from entering into contracts for the target\ncompany's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes\nSEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could\nalso have no affect. \"If this friend of the court brief is\npotent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the\nTexas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment\ncould be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing,\" Leuffer said.\n    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal\nbattle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court\nawarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later\nreduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now\ntotals 10.3 billion dlrs.\n    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal\nbankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to\navoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security\nbond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.\n    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of\nJuly 20.\n    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other\nanalysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a\nsignificant role. \"The other argument is the court will ignore\nit (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court\nbriefs,\" he said.\n    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not\nexpect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.\n\"Everyday, you're going to see something like this,\" Cohen\nsaid.\n    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe\nthat the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it\nbelieved the 10b-13 rule was involved. \"I think what the market\nsensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that\nthey may reach for the stars and fall on their face,\" Sales\nsaid. \"They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas,\" said Joel\nFischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other\nanalysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal\nlaw that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or\nrefuses to hear its case.\n    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to\nthe 10b-13 issue.\n    Sales said the point was argued and the courts\n\"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the\nlegal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we\ncan correct that misimpression\".\n    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many\npossible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that\nTexaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded\nby Pennzoil.\n    \"The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae\n(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit\ndisturbed,\" said Cohen.\n    \"What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight\nmove down the road could have a multiplying effect,\" he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

They\nwould bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the\npast,\" Hannes said.\n    U.S. domestic bonds are not affected by the change.\n    U.S. companies with Eurobonds issued through the\nNetherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid\nthe tax liability, a Treasury Department spokesman said. But\nthey could refinance at lower rates because of the general\ndecline in interest rates, so the Department does not expect\nU.S. firms to be hurt by the decision, the spokesman said.\nNegotiations between the United States and the Netherlands\ncontinued without success since the late 1970's. The\ndifferences centered on U.S. concern over residents of third\ncountries avoiding U.S. taxes by using the treaty with the\nNetherlands Antilles.\n Reuter\n&#3;",

But he\nadded that increased competitiveness seems to be behind the\nmove towards greater production in the United States.\n    \"What's peculiar about this group is that it's the most\nsuccessful in terms of profitability, decreasing costs, and\nincreasing quality,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n    Those companies increasing offshore production are at the\nopposite end of the spectrum, he said, not meeting the\nproduction goals they set for themselves.\n    He cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large,\nunusually profitable businesses representing a diversity of\nindustries and regions. The typical respondent was a large\nmanufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;",
